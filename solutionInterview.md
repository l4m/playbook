# Solution Interview Script
## Welcome (Set the Stage)
(2 minutes)

As before, you need to briefly set the stage for how the interview works:

Thank you very much for taking the time to speak with us today.

We are currently working on a photo and video sharing service designed for parents. I got the idea after becoming a parent and experiencing some frustrations firsthand with existing solutions.

The interview will work like this. I'll start by describing the main problems we are tackling and then I'll ask whether any of those resonate with you. I also would like to show you an early demo of the application.

I'd like to stress that we don't have a finished product yet, and our objective is to learn from you, not to sell or pitch anything to you.

Does that sound good?

## Collect Demographics (Test Customer Segment)
(2 minutes)

Ask some introductory questions to collect basic demographics that you believe will drive how you segment and qualify your early adopters. If you've already interviewed this prospect, you can skip this section unless there are additional questions you've uncovered since you last interviewed him.

Before we go on to the problems, I'd like to learn a little about you:

* How many kids do you have?
* How old are they?
* Do you share photos online?
* Do you share videos online?
* How often?
* With whom?

## Tell a Story (Set Problem Context)
(2 minutes)

As before, illustrate the top three problems with a story:

Great, thanks. So, let me tell you about the problems we are tackling.

Once we have kids, we found ourselves taking a lot more photos than before, and especially more videos. We also started getting regular requests (as in, weekly) for updates from grandparents and other family members. But we found it difficult to share all this content on a regular basis because the process was too time-consuming and sometimes painful.

We had to organize the files, resize them, and babysit the upload process. Video was even more painful because we often had to convert the video first (transcode) into a web-friendly format.

Like most other parents, we are sleep-deprived and don't have as much free time as before. Having kids has given us a whole new appreciation for free time, and we'd much rather spend our time doing other things.

Does any of this resonate with you?

If you don't sense a strong problem resonance, don't continue with the Solution interview, but rather use the Problem interview script to learn more about how the prospects solve these problems today.

## Demo (Test Solution)
(15 minutes)

This is the heart of the interview.

Go through each problem in turn and illustrate how you solve it using the supporting demo.

<For each problem>

Illustrate how you solve the problem using the supporting demo.

Pause after each one and ask if they have any questions.

<Repeat for other problems>

So, that's what the application looks like right now. We are trying to prioritize what to finish and release first and would like to ask you a few more questions:

* What part of the demo resonated with you the most?
* Which could you live without?
* Are there any additional features you think are missing?

## Test Pricing (Revenue Streams)
(3 minutes)

Finding the right price is more art than science.

Usually the right price is on the customer accepts, but with a little resistance.

Test pricing using the "starting price" you determined earlier for this customer segment.

Don't ask the customer for ballpark pricing. Instead, tell him your pricing model (with or without anchoring) and gauge his response immediately afterward. If he accepts the pricing, make a note of whether he hesitated or readiliy accepted.

So, let's talk about pricing next.

We will launch the service using a subscription model.

Would you pay $49 a year for unlimited photo and video sharing?

## Wrapping Up (the Ask)
(2 minutes)

We are done with all the hypothesis questions, but you still have two more questions to ask.

The first is permission to follow up with them to test the service when it's ready. If possible, try to secure a more concrete commitment that just a verbal one.

The second is to ask for referrals to other people you could potentially interview.

Thanks a lot for your time today. You have been very helpful.

As I mentioned at the start, this isn't a finished product, but we are close to launching sometime soon. Would you be interested in trying out the product when we have something ready?

Also, we are looking to interview more people like yourself. Do you konw any other parents of young kids who we could interview?

## Document Results
(5 minutes)

Take the five minutes immediately following an interview to document your results while they're still fresh in your mind.

It helps to create a template like the one that follows so that you can quickly jot down the responses to the hypothesis you set out to test.

As before, have each interviewer independently fill out the form first. Then have a debriefing session later where you compare notes and make a final entry into whatever system you use to record your interview results.

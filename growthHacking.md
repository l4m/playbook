# Growth Hacking

## Don't Knock the Hustle
* There are no silver bullets.
* It is not easy.
* It requires hard work and dedication.
* Like climbing Everest it is a long haul.

Opportunity to do things differently. Be unique and edgy.

## Buzz is Cheap
* Hype is not earned.
* You do not have to be special to get media attention.

## Create a Meme
* Memes are remembered
* Memes are shared
* Memes spread like a virus

### What is your meme?
* The essence of what you are solving
* Short memorable idea
* Should be largest text on your landing page
* Avoid rotating banners (focus on one meme)
* Quotes get retweeted becuase it is knowledge that has been distilled and is easy to spread.
* Give your product viral potential

## Copywriting is a Drug
* Simple and understandable
* Not fancy with complex language
* Show your personality
* Put a human face on your product
* Change behavior
* Make people do what you want
* Audience should enjoy time at your site
* Play into how customers feel about your product
* Address objections in a fun way
* *Case Study*

## Design is Social Proof
* Window into team and company
* Shows you care about details and care about how you look
* Should make customers comfortable giving you money
* Credibility

### Good Design
* Fonts: Should be uncommon
* Colors: Muted schemes with CTAs that pop!
* Spacing: Open space
* Imagery: Large images with emotional appeal
* *Case Study*

## Data Ruins a Story
* Pitch the idea not metrics
* Vague can be good
* Start marketing with intrigue
* Target community of beta testers
* *Stack*

## Email Addresses Are Foreplay of Profit
* Captive audience
* How shown intent
* Implied permission to sell

This is your audience!
* Not always about new customers
* Create more for existing customers
* What does the existing niche need?

Give value and ask for little. Make the sign-up process as frictionless as possible.

## Virality is an Equation
* [Virial coefficient](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virial_coefficient)
* How many new customers does each customer bring?
	* 1 = Stagnent
	* Less than 1 = Losing users
	* Greater than 1 = Positive growth
*  You can plan viral
	* Get more users from the ones you have
	* Give them a reason to share
	* Build affiliate programs with incentives for others to promote you
	* Bloggers share more positive info about your product when then get paid for the traffic they send

## Social Proof
* Humans do not want to be alone
* Let customers know people are doing what they are considering
* We are conditioned to rely on acts of others
* Lemmings
* Provide enough convincing to encourage them to try
* Prominently display testimonials
* Give clues that others are already doing it

## Your Gut Lies
* You are probably wrong
* Data provides unexpected insights
* Data decides arguments (prove it)
* Measure everything
* Developers should hack custom analytics solution
* URL Shorteners
	* Track links
	* Use different URLs for different campaigns
* Google Analytics
	* Use filters to search for specific pages
	* Then find sources of traffic to that page

## Awareness Strategies are Asinine
* Conversions not impressions
* Buying ads only helps when return (LTV) is greater than cost (CCA)
* Metrics
	* Cost Per Click
	* Conversion Rate

## Write Your Own Algorithms for Ad Buys
* Do not trust algorithms companies use to sell you with
* Write your own based on meaningful metrics
*Example*
* [BuySellAds](http://buysellads.com)
* More expensive tweets are not always better
* Research followers with keyword searches
* Compare two options for times keyword occurs in follower profiles
* Niche audience is greater than total audience
* Effective niche followers: Compare keyword results with cost

## Create a growth team
* Executive support is fundamental to success - allows for risk-taking 
* Team responsibilities: 
	* analytics/data science
	* direct acquisition marketing
	* product development
	* culture 
	* hiring
	* monetization/mobile

## ```{segments}```
Create an image of your customer segments.

## Know Your Persona

Personas are the foundation of a great user experience. A persona represents a cluster of users exhibiting similar behaviors, attitudes and motivations.

This includes purchasing decisions, use of technology, customer service preferences and lifestyle choices. We must figure out who is going to use our products.

Identifying the needs and goals of your customers helps you design and deliver effective products. Create a persona and validate it.

Create personas for multiple segments. Compare and prioritize them.

## Keep it Simple

Feeback is inversely proportional to polish. Design for design's sake is masturbation. Creating an elaborate persona is a good way to flex your skills but not the most efficient method of problem solving.

## Sketchy

Quick sketches are excellent for communicating ideas. They allow you to express your thoughts quickly and obtain feedback. A paper persona is shared, discussed and edited easily. This allows continual improvement and encourages everyone on the team to participate.

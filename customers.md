## ```{segments}```
Create an image of your customer.

## Know Your Persona

Personas are the foundation of a great user experience. A persona represents users exhibiting similar behaviors, attitudes and motivations.

This includes purchasing decisions, use of technology, customer service preferences and lifestyle choices. We must figure out who is going to use our products.

Identifying the needs and goals of your customers helps you design and deliver effective products. Create a persona, validate and iterate.

Create personas for multiple segments. Compare and prioritize them.

## WTF?
### This is not a pitch.
### Image of your cutomer.

Once you think you understand your customer segment, make a persona. In a best case scenario you would complete this task after your initial round of problem interviews.

A persona is a fictitious, specific and detailed description of a typical customer.

The persona should be a believable composite, rather than one specific person, so choose a name that doesn't have strong associations for you. The picture reminds you that your product is being used by a real person with needs and quirks.

Demographics add the details that fill out the persona's story. These can include a wide range of factual data, such as gender, age, location, employment and relationship status. Just make sure the demographics you track are in someway meaningful to your product. Demographic information helps you picture this person clearly in your mind.

Behaviors are observable actions that are related to the purpose of your product. What do people DO that indicate they would be interested in your product? How are they solving the problem without your product? Understanding these behaviors helps you identify target users to interview.

Needs are underlying desires that people have. Goals are the outcomes that a person wants to achieve. What outcomes are people trying to accomplish? What underlying needs can you identify that drive their behaviors? Identifying needs and goals helps you develop empathy, so you can design features that fit user needs.

Create one persona per segment you are targeting. Use them to answer product questions. Use these as filters in your research.

## Keep it Simple

Feeback is inversely proportional to polish. Design for design's sake is masturbation. Creating an elaborate persona is a good way to flex your skills but not the most efficient method of problem solving.

## Sketchy

Quick sketches are excellent for communicating ideas. They allow you to express your thoughts quickly and obtain feedback. A paper persona is shared, discussed and edited easily. This allows continual improvement and encourages everyone on the team to participate.


## Benefits

* Teams align on who they are solving for.
* Iteration helps us adjust sights on moving targets.
* Customers make decisions rather than the loudest in the room.

## Segmentation
Design
Marketing

Not all traffic is good.

Chicken / legs, thigs, wings, light, dark

Even most individuals have multiple personas.

* Golf Club
* Rock Show

Break the market down into smaller segments.
In our user research we start uncovering who our potential customers are.
We need to narrow down these characteristics and get as specific about them as possible.
We are looking for early adopters not mainstream customers.

### Sketch

I often encounter people who are scared of design because they say they cannot draw. But in all honesty you do not have to be Leonardo da Vinci to perform the basics sketches required for communicating our ideas. As long as you can draw simple shapes you can perform leanux activities.

### Tools

* Grab a sharpie and a piece of paper.  
* Divide the paper into four sections.


### Clothespin People


### Upper Left

Think about who your customer is. What is their name and what are the doing?

In the upper left hand quadrant of your paper draw a circle. Now draw a horizontal line underneath it. Come down and draw the arms and legs.

Remember every person exists in a context. So put that person in a place. Draw a line in that quadrant around his knees. Now decide whether he is inside or outside. Draw artifacts helping others understand where this person is.

Now draw an expresion on your personas face. How are they feeling in this scenario?

Now give them a talk bubble and write what they are thinking. What is going on in their life making them a good customer for us?

Now give your persona a name and write it above them. Remember this is a fictional person, not somebody you actually know. But at least now you know what to call your customer. You no longer have to refer to them as a segment.

### Demographics

Demographics are the extra details that add richness to a person. Label the bottom left quadrant demographics.

Next take sticky notes and write one idea on each one. This is the factual information describing your persona.
Are the married, do they have kids?
How old are they, what kind of job do they do?
Brainstorm the demographic information about your persona.
Come up with 10 ideas.

Think about what drop-downs and checkboxes you would click if trying to filter down to this specific person.

Divide them into two piles.
The ones you think are most important and the ones you think are less important.
Write the ones from your most important pile on your paper.

Now...take a step back and each person tell their neighbor the current story about your persona.


### Behaviors

Write behaviors in the top right quadrant.

Behaviors are what people to do indicate they are a likely customer.

Use verbs.

What suggests they are trying to solve the problem?

Do they same with your sticky notes. Come of with 10 items one on each notesote. Start broad. Then narrow them down.

This should be a little more challenging. But work quickly rather than over thinking. Now sort them into the two piles.

The ones that you keep should be relevant to your product and the vision of your company. Write the top 5 down as bullet points in your behaviors section.


### Goals


This is the most important section but it is also a little abstract.
Look at the behaviors and ask why your person does those things.
These goals should be specific to things you can use your products to accomplish.
Break out your sticky notes and comes up with 10 needs and goals.
Go farther than you would naturally to get as many ideas as you can come up with.
Some will be very tactical.
Some will be emotional.
These will help you guide your product design.
Now divide them into two piles.
Next write the top 5 in the needs and goals section.


### Review


Now look at your persona and determine if it is a caricature.
If it is, you probably want to tone it down.
You want to like the person, not laugh at them.

Is this an actual person?
If yes, try again and make it a general profile.
We should not be making products for individuals.

Make sure it embodies the most common attributes that people who would like your product have.
It should be specific but we need it to apply to enough people to make building the product worthwhile.


### Share

Share your persona with your team and solicit feedback.
Better yet, have each team member create their own and then describe their persona to the group.
Then find the common attributes and make a composite.


### Iterate

Like everything lean ux this is an iterative of cycle.
We should be constantly incorporating feedback into improving everything we do.

### Different Strokes


### WWJD

What would Johnny do?
How would he react or feel about a potential addition or change to your product?
This is the level of intimacy and empathy I want us having for our customers.
If the customer does not care, it is essentially waste.

Hang one above your desk.
Make a life size card board cut out to have in the office.
Have some “What would Johnny do?” bracelets made.
Just make sure your persona is considered in all product decisions.

We are solving problems for people not customer segments.

### 2 Working with People

Tap into their expertise to reveal what is holding them back.

#### 2.1 Listening

#### 2.2 Giving Feedback

#### 2.3 Resolving Conflicts

#### 2.4 Building Agreement

#### 2.5 Hurdles

#### 2.6 Checklist

* Practice deep listening to understand the problems the team faces and build trust. Give your full attention to the person talking, and ask clarifying questions to check that you have understood what they are saying.
* When giving feedback, separate what you saw or heard from your feelings about the situation. Give specific examples of what you noticed rather than general comments. Tell them what you saw or heard, and then ask about their explanation of events. Now put your heads together to come up with ideas for handling the situation next time.
* If a conflict erupts, make sure all sides get to share their view point. Don't step in to resolve every conflict for the team because otherwise they rely on you as a peacemaker rather than learning to get along.
* Use gradients of agreement to reveal the level of support for a change. This allows the team to find out whether there is major or only minor disagreements.

### 3 Leading Change

People need to understand what's driving the change before they'll throw energy into it. Engage them in designing change by asking questions and building on their ideas.

#### 3.2 Asking Questions

#### 3.3 Encouraging Learning

#### 3.4 Facilitating Meetings

#### 3.5 Hurdles

#### 3.6 Checklist

* Share you passion for Agile, with being too fanatical. Talk about it, demonstrate it, and offer to help others with it. Encourage and inspire the team that Agile can and does work.
* Sell the problem to the team. Help them see why they need to change. What are the long-term implications of staying with the status quo? Also talk to the team members individually. How will they personally benefit from the change?
* When you meet resistance, try to understand where it's coming from. Is the problem with the idea or with the way you presented it? Are there good reasons to be concerned about the proposed idea? Are you listening properly to their concerns?
* Ask questions to engage the team in improving their Agile process. Try asking for help to enlist support, ask thinking questions to provoke reflection, and use Five Whys for root cause analysis.
* Encourage different ways to learn about Agile: leave books around the office, share blogs that you read, and point people to podcasts. Organize presentations and study groups that are open to other teams in the organization. Let people know about upcoming Agile events, and take people with you to the local Agile user group.
* Make new meetings easy for the team by facilitating then the first time around. Give them a running commentary so they can hear your thought process about running the meeting. The next time, help the team prepare for the meeting, and give them feedback afterward.

## [II Planning as a Team](part2.md)

### 5 Daily Standup

* What did I do yesterday?
* What will I do today?
* What is in my way?

These questions are a good start. You want the team to adopt the daily standup as their own meeting; it's where they decide who's working on what, and it encourages them to self-organize.

The daily standup reveals how well team members are working together. When it is quick, high-energy, and self-managed, then the team is on the right track.

#### 5.1 Standing Up

#### 5.2 For the Team by the Team

#### 5.3 Handling Issues

#### 5.4 Setting the Time

#### 5.5 When to Coach

#### 5.6 Hurdles

#### 5.7 Checklist

* Find a space that the team can run their daily standup around their team board. If they don't have room in their workspace, then use a portable team board.
* Make the time that the daily standup runs a team decision. You can run it more than once a day, if not everyone works the same hours.
* Encourage the team to keep their replies short and sweet. The three-question formula can help the team get started, but don't let this become a straightjacket for daily standup conversation.
* Keep the daily standup flowing; a speaking token puts this in control of the team.
* Ask the customer along to the daily standup to give her progress and updates.
* Gather issues that come up on a whiteboard where everyone can see the. Prioritize it with the team, and follow up afterward.
* Review the effectiveness of the daily standup in the retrospective, and experiment with the format.

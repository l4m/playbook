## [I Coaching Basics](part1.md)

### 1 Starting the Journey

**Mission:** Help teams produce great software by applying agile.

**Learn:**

* Basic coaching skills
* Strategies to implement change

#### 1.1 What does an Agile coach do?

#### 1.2 Developing a Coaching Attitude

#### 1.3 Getting Ready to Coach

#### 1.4 How to Start Coaching

#### 1.5 Maintaining the Pace

#### 1.6 Hurdles

#### 1.7 Checklist

* Practice explaining Agile to others.
* Work out the best way to be introduced to the team.
* Find ways to show that you apply Agile principles yourself.
* Apply the PrOpER cycle to your coaching interventions. Start with the problem, consider at least three different options that you can take, pick one and try that as an experiment, and then review the outcome.
* Pause to reflect and learn from your mistakes.
* Look for opportunities to learn from other Agile coaches, both inside and outside your company.
* When the team is running an effective Agile process, it's probably time to move on.

### 2 Working with People

Tap into their expertise to reveal what is holding them back.

#### 2.1 Listening

#### 2.2 Giving Feedback

#### 2.3 Resolving Conflicts

#### 2.4 Building Agreement

#### 2.5 Hurdles

#### 2.6 Checklist

* Practice deep listening to understand the problems the team faces and build trust. Give your full attention to the person talking, and ask clarifying questions to check that you have understood what they are saying.
* When giving feedback, separate what you saw or heard from your feelings about the situation. Give specific examples of what you noticed rather than general comments. Tell them what you saw or heard, and then ask about their explanation of events. Now put your heads together to come up with ideas for handling the situation next time.
* If a conflict erupts, make sure all sides get to share their view point. Don't step in to resolve every conflict for the team because otherwise they rely on you as a peacemaker rather than learning to get along.
* Use gradients of agreement to reveal the level of support for a change. This allows the team to find out whether there is major or only minor disagreements.

### 3 Leading Change

People need to understand what's driving the change before they'll throw energy into it. Engage them in designing change by asking questions and building on their ideas.

#### 3.1 Introducing Change

#### 3.2 Asking Questions

#### 3.3 Encouraging Learning

#### 3.4 Facilitating Meetings

#### 3.5 Hurdles

#### 3.6 Checklist

* Share you passion for Agile, with being too fanatical. Talk about it, demonstrate it, and offer to help others with it. Encourage and inspire the team that Agile can and does work.
* Sell the problem to the team. Help them see why they need to change. What are the long-term implications of staying with the status quo? Also talk to the team members individually. How will they personally benefit from the change?
* When you meet resistance, try to understand where it's coming from. Is the problem with the idea or with the way you presented it? Are there good reasons to be concerned about the proposed idea? Are you listening properly to their concerns?
* Ask questions to engage the team in improving their Agile process. Try asking for help to enlist support, ask thinking questions to provoke reflection, and use Five Whys for root cause analysis.
* Encourage different ways to learn about Agile: leave books around the office, share blogs that you read, and point people to podcasts. Organize presentations and study groups that are open to other teams in the organization. Let people know about upcoming Agile events, and take people with you to the local Agile user group.
* Make new meetings easy for the team by facilitating then the first time around. Give them a running commentary so they can hear your thought process about running the meeting. The next time, help the team prepare for the meeting, and give them feedback afterward.

### 4 Building and Agile Team

Cohesive teams take time to jell. Establish conditions for teamwork. Environment should support working together to build software.

#### 4.1 Helping a Team Jell

#### 4.2 Creating a Team Space

#### 4.3 Balancing Roles

#### 4.4 Energizing the Team

#### 4.5 Hurdles

#### 4.6 Checklist

* Create opportunities for the team to get to know each other, which helps the team jell. Regularly spend informal time together, such as lunch or drinks.
* Create a shared workspace to help the team work together well. Try to get the whole team sitting together.
* Make role responsibilities clear. Get the customer support they need to work within the team.
* Ensure the team has a reachable but challenging goal. Make sure the work is neither too easy nor too hard.
* Arrange food or drink to celebrate a release. Ask customers and management to that the team.

## [II Planning as a Team](part2.md)

### 5 Daily Standup

* What did I do yesterday?
* What will I do today?
* What is in my way?

These questions are a good start. You want the team to adopt the daily standup as their own meeting; it's where they decide who's working on what, and it encourages them to self-organize.

The daily standup reveals how well team members are working together. When it is quick, high-energy, and self-managed, then the team is on the right track.

#### 5.1 Standing Up

#### 5.2 For the Team by the Team

#### 5.3 Handling Issues

#### 5.4 Setting the Time

#### 5.5 When to Coach

#### 5.6 Hurdles

#### 5.7 Checklist

* Find a space that the team can run their daily standup around their team board. If they don't have room in their workspace, then use a portable team board.
* Make the time that the daily standup runs a team decision. You can run it more than once a day, if not everyone works the same hours.
* Encourage the team to keep their replies short and sweet. The three-question formula can help the team get started, but don't let this become a straightjacket for daily standup conversation.
* Keep the daily standup flowing; a speaking token puts this in control of the team.
* Ask the customer along to the daily standup to give her progress and updates.
* Gather issues that come up on a whiteboard where everyone can see the. Prioritize it with the team, and follow up afterward.
* Review the effectiveness of the daily standup in the retrospective, and experiment with the format.

### 6 Understanding What to Build

To deliver valuable software, understand both user and business benefits.

User stories underpin all the work an Agile team does--they're the basis of plans, development, and testing. The whole point of user stories is to ask questions to better understand what users need and to find ways of breaking requirements down.

#### 6.1 Life Cycle of a User Story

#### 6.2 Encouraging Conversations

#### 6.3 Working With Cards

#### 6.4 Confirming the Details

#### 6.5 Hurdles

#### 6.6 Checklist

* Teach the team the "Card, Conversation, Confirmation" mantra to help them remember that a user story has three essential elements: a conversation, a card, and a confirmation. Encourage the team to refine each user story through conversation with the customer.
* Show the team how to write story cards by doing it yourself and then stopping to make room for the team to write them instead.
* Make sure cards or ntes are available in the team space and in meetings to discuss stories.
* "As a…user I want…capability so that…benefit" can be a useful template for user stories. Watch this does not become a form-filling exercise; such templates should prompt the team to ask questions. Once they're asking the right questions, the team can drop the template.
* Suport the customer in working out details of stories before planning sessions. It helps shape the user stories if you get a few team members involved; they can ask questions and suggest story tests.

### 7 Planning Ahead

Encourage the team to create plans of different granularities. They are likely to need both a rough plan that looks a few months into the future and a more detailed plan for their next iteration.

**Prepare:** Work with the team--especially the customer--to get the user stories ready before the meeting. Slice the stories down as fine as you can without losing sight or the benefit.

**Fry one at a time:** Have one conversation at a time. If the team is talking about how to develop a story and then gets sidetracked by how important that story is compared to another, they can go round in circles.

**Keep stirring:** Keep the meeting flowing, and refocus conversations to prevent them from getting stuck.

**Control the heat:** The team may be under pressure to commit to more work that can be finished in the iteration. Help them work through the design details so they can give realistic estimates that take their past delivery rate (velocity) into account.

#### 7.1 Preparing for Planning

#### 7.2 Understanding Priorities

#### 7.3 Sizing the Work

#### 7.4 Review and Commit

#### 7.5 Keeping Track

#### 7.6 Hurdles

#### 7.7 Checklist

* Create an agenda with the team for planning meetings, possibly breaking planning into more than one session. Show the team how to use the agenda in the meeting to refocus conversations when they drift.
* Remind the team to work with the customer before planning meetings to prepare the user stories.
* Make sure everyone has an opportunity during planning meetings to ask questions about the user stories.
* Encourage design discussions before estimating the work. These often flow better if the customer steps out of the meeting.
* Suggest the team do a task breakdown for any large stories. Tasks can be posted up on the team board along with the stories during the iteration to help the team coordinate their work. However, recommend to the team that it's more important to track completed stories than tasks.
* Help the team estimate consistently by creating a story card matrix that groups stories with the same estimate together.
* Take care that the team works at a sustainable pace and doesn't make promises that their velocity shows they're unlikely to keep. Suggest the team check their capacity before making the final cut of what stories should be in the plan.
* Before the meeting breaks up, make sure that someone takes the cards and puts them up on the team board. The team also needs to take note of what stories are planned along with the initial estimates so they have a baseline they can use when calculating their velocity.

### 8 Keeping It Visible

Help the team set up a team board that radiates their plans for all so see.

#### 8.1 The Team Board

#### 8.2 Big Visible Charts

#### 8.3 Maintaining the Team Board

#### 8.4 Hurdles

#### 8.5 Checklist

* Involve the team in designing and constructing a team board so they can make their iteration plan visible. This makes it easy for everyone to see what needs to be done and coordinate their work.
* It's the team's board, so they can use it to post personal stuff and charts that help them focus on improving the way they work.
* Find a board configuration that works for the team. Select materials that make it easy to read from a distance. If you use a color scheme, then provide a key to explain what the colors mean.
* Encourage the team to tag the cards they're working on with names or avatars. This helps make it more visible when someone is blocked.
* Don't bury information in electronic information fridges. However, if you have remote team members or the team is workin as part of a large program, the team will need to create an electronic summary of their iteration plan.
* Use iteration burndown charts only as a crude measure of team confidence that they're on track. Encourage the team to update this themselves at the daily standup or by nominating a tracker. A release burnup chart will be a better indication of progress and helps the customer spot whether they need to descope or budget more iterations.
* Clear the board at the end of the iteration. Review visible charts during the iteration, and retire them when the team no longer finds them useful.

## [Part III Caring About Quality](part3.md)

## 9 Getting to "Done"

Ever watched little kids playing soccer?

Agile teams need to learn how to work together to meet their goals. Each person on the team plays a part in getting the work done. Help them get clear on exactly what being done means and how they can collaborate to make it happen.

#### 9.1 Who Does the Testing?

#### 9.2 Defining What "Done" Means

#### 9.3 Planning in Testing

#### 9.4 Managing Bugs

#### 9.5 Getting Feedback Early

#### 9.6 Recovering from Not Getting Done

#### 9.7 Hurdles

#### 9.8 Checklist

* Define what "done" means with the team. Display this as a check list in the team workspace. Include testing done by customers, developers, and testers, but exclude testing done outside the team.
* Make sure that testing is considered in iteration planning so testing tasks are understood by the whole team.
* Encrouage developers to work closely with testers and their customers to get early feedback on stories. Ask the customer to reserve time every day to answer questions from the team.
* Recommend that software is made available to customers during the iteration. Encourage the team to look for slices of user stories that can be delivered early rather than waiting until the iteration ends.
* Use the team board to display bugs that need to be fixed before the end of the iteration. Instead of creating a hidden backlog in the bug tracker, ask testers to work with the customer to turn bugs that are deferred into new user stories that can be planned into future iterations.
* If the team doesn't get all the stories done, talk about why this happened with the whole team in the demo or retrospective. Clear the board at the end of the iteration, and take any incomplete stories into iteration planning. Help the team gather velocity data so they don't overcommit in the next iteration.

### 10 Driving Development with Tests

Developers can be confident they're building on a solid foundation, and testers can focus on edge cases instead of wasting time on trivial problems.

#### 10.1 Introducing Test-Driven Development

#### 10.2 Continuous Integration

#### 10.3 Sustaining Test-Driven Development

#### 10.4 Hurdles

#### 10.5 Checklist

* Allow plenty of time for making the transition to Test-Driven Development. This is a large change for a team to take on board in one go. Take an iterative approach to introducing TDD. Spend time with the team understanding what the blockers are, and then apply the PrOpER cycle.
* A completely greenfield project can start with writing tests first. When the team has to retrofit tests to existing code, they'll need time to figure out where to start. They can start writing a few automated tests per day or work test-after rather than test-first until they have a handle on how to test any legacy code.
* The whole team has to agree to the approach; all developers will need to write and run tests for TDD to work. Make sure the team understands the problems that TDD will solve.
* Factor time into plans for the team to learn how to write automated tests. Support the team's learning by organizing training and coding dojos.
* Get the team together to agree on a test strategy; unit tests in the middle layer are usually a safe place to start. Don't forget to get agreement on automated testing basics, such as where tests will be stored and how they will be run. Review the test strategy with the team to work out where to go next.
* Continuous Integration is an attitude, not a set of tools. Suggest that the team start with a synchronous CI process before relying on a build server.
* If the team uses a CI server, make it easy for the team to take responsibility for fixing broken tests. Work on making build status visible to the whole team rather than buried in email.
* Watch out for slow-running tests. Encourage the team to factor time into their plans for improving their build scripts and infrastructure. Test coverage can help the team get a better understanding of how well they're doing.

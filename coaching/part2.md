## II Planning as a Team

### 5 Daily Standup

* What did I do yesterday?
* What will I do today?
* What is in my way?

These questions are a good start. You want the team to adopt the daily standup as their own meeting; it's where they decide who's working on what, and it encourages them to self-organize.

The daily standup reveals how well team members are working together. When it is quick, high-energy, and self-managed, then the team is on the right track.

#### 5.1 Standing Up

The meeting takes less time when everyone is on their feet in the team workspace around the board. If they are reluctant run an experiment for a couple of weeks.

#### 5.2 For the Team by the Team

It is essential to get the message across to the team that their daily standup is for them to synchronize their work. It is not help for a project manager or team lead to gather progress from the team or give feedback on their work. Encourage the team to direct their answers toward other team members.

Keep conversation focused on work in the plan. Not personal details or other projects. Nudge conversations along with one of the three questions if a person hesitates.

##### Establishing a Team Focus

If you notice that team members continue to treat the meeting as a report to you, come right out and say, "Please, can you direct your replies to the whole team? The daily standup is for you all to work out what you need to do today, not me."

Avoid giving praise, saying "Great!" or even "Thank you" after someone lets the team know what they completed.

##### Team Controls the Flow

A speaking token may help keep meetings flowing. The person holding the token becomes more aware of the rest of the team waiting.

Talk about the progress on tasks rather than giving exhaustive accounts of what they did yesterday. Do not try to solve every problem as it comes up.

##### Who Takes Part

The whole team comes to daily standup: developers, testers, designers, customers, Agile coach, and so on. The focus should be work in the current plan. Make sure conversations can be followed by the whole team.

#### 5.3 Handling Issues

Leave the discussion on how to solve blockers until the end of the daily standup. Move on once the problem is understood. The team won't have the full picture until everyone has spoken, and each issue may not require the whole team to solve it.

Write items requiring follow-up on a whiteboard that everyone can see to create a parking lot for issues. Prioritize parking lot at end of meeting and work out who needs to be involved in any follow-up. Issues addressed can be wiped off once resolved.

The daily standup should not be a substitute for other meetings. If it throws up the need for a longer discussion with the whole team, suggest the team arranges a meeting to cover it rather than tacking on a conversation to the end of their daily standup.

Check dependencies on items outside the team and incorporate reminders to follow-up.

#### 5.4 Setting the Time

Most teams prefer to have the daily standup at the start of the working day to discuss who's working on what before getting immersed in their work.

Find a time that works for everyone and make it a team decision. Encourage the team to experiment with different approaches until they find a good compromise.

#### 5.5 When to Coach

The coach acts as the conscience of the team. Gently remind the team about what they planned to do if they're straying from it. There's a real art to this; you don't want to come across as nagging. Wait until they're actually drifting; then make an observation that what you see them doing is different that what they planned. Ask them whether it's really a problem, and if so, how they're planning to handle it.

Remind the team about how many days before the next demo or release and ask them to check that the team board reflects what they're working on now.

They need to take time, during each iteration, to work with their customer to get user stories ready for the next planning session. They also need to follow up on actions from their retrospective and get those done by the end of the iteration.

As a coach, keep an inquiring mind, and be on the lookout for opportunities for improvement. The daily standup often reveals areas where team members need coaching support.

* Is everyone engaged, motivated, and excited?
* Are they making progress and working on high-priority tasks?
* Are they working together and helping each other?
* Are they able to concentrate and do their job without interruptions?

#### 5.6 Hurdles

The following are some hurdles you may encounter.

##### People Arriving Late for the Meeting

Don't repeat information as latecomers arrive. Help them become aware of their behavior, because this can be enough to trigger a change.

##### Meetings Take Too Long

If the daily standup regularly takes more than fifteen minutes, look for ways to speed it up. Cover only what is relevant for teammates to get the big picture. It is difficult to create a sense of ownership with a large team. When people start caring about their own tasks, teamwork starts to break down.

##### Daily Standup is Hijacked

Recommend they talk with the customer about their requests, so these can be considered in the next planning meeting. The remedy lies in education about how Agile works.

##### The Team Isn't Working on the Planned Tasks

Encourage the team to add cards to represent new tasks on the team board so it's clear what they current plan is. Also remind them to remove any tasks that they're not planning to do anymore. 

Work with the customer to establish a budget for support and tracking how much time is being spent on support against that.

##### Daily Standup Isn't Wanted

Check to make sure individuals are making progress. Discuss team concerns in the retrospective.

##### Not Everyone Can Stand

You don't want a person to end up in the center of the circle or outside it. Consider running the daily standup as a sit down meeting so everyone is on the same level, but be aware that if you sit down, it's likely to take loner.

#### 5.7 Checklist

* Find a space that the team can run their daily standup around their team board. If they don't have room in their workspace, then use a portable team board.
* Make the time that the daily standup runs a team decision. You can run it more than once a day, if not everyone works the same hours.
* Encourage the team to keep their replies short and sweet. The three-question formula can help the team get started, but don't let this become a straightjacket for daily standup conversation.
* Keep the daily standup flowing; a speaking token puts this in control of the team.
* Ask the customer along to the daily standup to give her progress and updates.
* Gather issues that come up on a whiteboard where everyone can see the. Prioritize it with the team, and follow up afterward.
* Review the effectiveness of the daily standup in the retrospective, and experiment with the format.

### 6 Understanding What to Build

To deliver valuable software, understand both user and business benefits.

User stories underpin all the work an Agile team does--they're the basis of plans, development, and testing. The whole point of user stories is to ask questions to better understand what users need and to find ways of breaking requirements down.

#### 6.1 Life Cycle of a User Story

Idea > Conversation > Cases > Tests > Feedback

Help the team understand that a user story evolves from one artifact into another over time through conversation with the customer. Encourage the team to keep asking questions to refine their understanding of what to implement.

##### Card, Conversation, Confirmation (3Cs)

**Card:** Writing stories on index cards to facilitate group conversations

**Conversation:** Asking questions and suggesting ways to split the story

**Confirmation:** Agreeing on what will be the tests uses to asses whether the story is complete

#### 6.2 Encouraging Conversations

It's the conversations about user stories that enable the team to understand what needs to be built. These conversations need to be driven by developers and testers, checking with the customer what they have understood they story details as they implement it.

New stories and future iterations are worked out in smaller groups with a customer and a couple of developers or a tester.

#### 6.3 Working With Cards

Record conversations about user stories with index cards or sticky notes. They are easier to group and move around when they are physical.

* Demonstrate writing cards, and then stop.
* When someone suggests a new idea, invite them to write their own card.
* As the story being discussed changes, add notes to the card.

Make it easy for the team to use cards any time, not just in planning meetings. Use a consistent layout:

* Title
* Story
* Effort

##### Story Templates

"As a…user, I want…capability so that…benefit."

This template helps the team remember to clarify who the user is and what the benefit of developing the story is.

Develop personas for different user roles. Arrange for the team to go out and meet real users in the setting that the software will be used in.

The purpose of a story template is to help the team learn to ask questions that improve their understanding. Always write the user story in language that can be understood by the whole team including the customer.

After the stories have been implemented as working software, the team relies on the tests, not the cards, for details about the story.

#### 6.4 Confirming the Details

Agree on what behaviors to implement. Pin down the scope of each story as a set of tests that need to pass for the story to be considered "done." These story tests (acceptance criteria) help the team clarify what needs to be built and how much work needs to be done.

Story tests start life as bullet points scribbled on the back of a story card. Advise the team this is enough detail until the point that the story is planned into their next iteration. Later, these notes are used during the iteration as the basis for writing runnable test scripts.

Team draws out story tests by walking through real examples. Examples help the team check that they understand what the software has to do and what behavior will meet customer needs. Examples also lead the team to explore situations that might need error handling.

Start by walking through a simple user interaction where a user achieves a goal. Now encourage the team to ask their customer questions like these:

* What data does the user enter?
* What does the user expect to see?
* Are there business rules that we need to be aware of?

Sketches of the user interface may help; rough pencil drawins are fine. It's the content and interaction that the team needs to understand, no the appearance.

Now prompt the team to ask about what could go wrong. 

User stories are a simple technique that a team can use for understanding their customer through talking about what users need. Show them how to use cards, and encourage them to get involved in conversations about user stories to offer their ideas and to draw out more details as story tests.

#### 6.5 Hurdles

The follow are some hurdles you may encounter.

##### No User-Facing Functionality

If you are working on a project to rework infrastructure or architecture, there is often no obvious user-facing functionality to describe.

User stories can also be used to wrap a bunch of technical tasks into a more meaningful description.

##### Requirements Must Be Documented

Take photos of cards, sketches and boards.

##### Team Can't Meet Up

Use some basic software that allows you to write virtual sticky notes instead of index cards.

#### 6.6 Checklist

* Teach the team the "Card, Conversation, Confirmation" mantra to help them remember that a user story has three essential elements: a conversation, a card, and a confirmation. Encourage the team to refine each user story through conversation with the customer.
* Show the team how to write story cards by doing it yourself and then stopping to make room for the team to write them instead.
* Make sure cards or ntes are available in the team space and in meetings to discuss stories.
* "As a…user I want…capability so that…benefit" can be a useful template for user stories. Watch this does not become a form-filling exercise; such templates should prompt the team to ask questions. Once they're asking the right questions, the team can drop the template.
* Suport the customer in working out details of stories before planning sessions. It helps shape the user stories if you get a few team members involved; they can ask questions and suggest story tests.

### 7 Planning Ahead

Encourage the team to create plans of different granularities. They are likely to need both a rough plan that looks a few months into the future and a more detailed plan for their next iteration.

**Prepare:** Work with the team--especially the customer--to get the user stories ready before the meeting. Slice the stories down as fine as you can without losing sight or the benefit.

**Fry one at a time:** Have one conversation at a time. If the team is talking about how to develop a story and then gets sidetracked by how important that story is compared to another, they can go round in circles.

**Keep stirring:** Keep the meeting flowing, and refocus conversations to prevent them from getting stuck.

**Control the heat:** The team may be under pressure to commit to more work that can be finished in the iteration. Help them work through the design details so they can give realistic estimates that take their past delivery rate (velocity) into account.

#### 7.1 Preparing for Planning

Encourage the team to work with the customer to get the user stories ready well before the planning day. This can be done by a couple of team members.

**Understand priorities:** Start with a team conversation about the user stories the customer would like to get in the next iteration to release.

**Size the work:** When the stories are understood, help the team work out what needs to be done to deliver the stories.

**Agree on the plan:** Wrap the meeting up by getting agreement on what can realistically be delivered.

* Create an agenda for planning meetings
* Prepare
* Refocus when conversation drifts

#### 7.2 Understanding Priorities

Recommend that the customer opens the meeting by 

* Explaining goal for next iteration or release.
* Presenting user stories supporting the goal.
* Ranks stories by importance.

Encourage the team to ask questions and look for opportunities to split stories down further. Prompt the team to review the tests for each story likely to be in the next iteration.

#### 7.3 Sizing the Work

* Visualize design options.
* Dig into technical details.

##### Decomposing into Tasks

Small pieces of work that contribute to the delivery of a user story. Tasks make it easier for the team to share the work and coordinate their efforts so several people can work on the same story.

Read the story to the team, and then ask what needs to happen.

##### Estimating, Not Guessing

Collaborate to estimate how long the stories will take to  complete without deciding who will do what. Do not pad estimates to allow for thing to go wrong. It is not possible to estimate interruptions.

Take time to research what needs to be done rather than guessing.

If a longer investigation is needed, suggest to the team that they plan a spike. A spike is a time boxed investigation with the goal of producing and estimate for a user story rather than producing code.

##### Arriving at an Estimate

* Discuss each story and agree on an estimate.
* Mark the estimate on the story card.
* Group cards with similar estimates into columns and order them from low to high.

#### 7.4 Review and Commit

The next part of planning is grouping the stories into an iteration schedule that the team can realistically deliver.

##### Laying Out Iterations

Lay out the story cards in the order that the development team plans to work on them. Put the highest-priority ones first unless there are risks, dependencies, or deadlines associated with particular cards. Allow customer to re-prioritize if necessary.

##### Looking Further Ahead

In an ideal world, the team would put a live release out to users at the end of every iteration. Use a roadmap based on story themes for anything more than 3 months out. Use a kanban queue for supporting live applications.

#### 7.5 Keeping Track

Someone needs to take responsibility for putting the stories and tasks up on the team board. Rotate this role within the team.

Putting tasks into a tracking tool can lead to micromanagement. Stakeholders are interested in whole user stories being finished rather than tasks because tasks aren't deliverables.

Keep a version of release plans in software because it needs to be shared more widely with stakeholders. Take a snapshot of planned stories and estimates to determine accuracy. Compare total story points planned with completed stories.

#### 7.6 Hurdles

The following are some hurdles you may encounter.

##### Customer Doesn't Know What They Want

Make sure they have a rough cut of stories before the planning meeting.

##### The Team Is Asked to Overcommit

If you see that the team is about to commit to far more than their velocity shows they're likely to achieve, warn them that there's a high risk that all the stories may not be delivered.

##### Plan Changes During the Iteration

Expect the team to create some additional tasks for a story as their understanding of the problem grows, but watch out if the tasks change a lot--that is a sign that the team didn't come to grips with what needed to be done in planning.

##### Meeting Has a Lot of Conflict or Tension

* Encourage team to explain their ideas and concerns to the customer.
* Ultimately what stories end up in the plan as to be a joint decision.
* Judge each solution on how simple it is to develop.

##### Team Velocity Drops

* Continue tracking velocity once it settles down to a reliable figure.
* Help the team notice any slowdowns and try to work out the root cause.

##### Planning Doesn't Make Sense

When the team is focused on bugs or out or the office for a period create a prioritized queue.

#### 7.7 Checklist

* Create an agenda with the team for planning meetings, possibly breaking planning into more than one session. Show the team how to use the agenda in the meeting to refocus conversations when they drift.
* Remind the team to work with the customer before planning meetings to prepare the user stories.
* Make sure everyone has an opportunity during planning meetings to ask questions about the user stories.
* Encourage design discussions before estimating the work. These often flow better if the customer steps out of the meeting.
* Suggest the team do a task breakdown for any large stories. Tasks can be posted up on the team board along with the stories during the iteration to help the team coordinate their work. However, recommend to the team that it's more important to track completed stories than tasks.
* Help the team estimate consistently by creating a story card matrix that groups stories with the same estimate together.
* Take care that the team works at a sustainable pace and doesn't make promises that their velocity shows they're unlikely to keep. Suggest the team check their capacity before making the final cut of what stories should be in the plan.
* Before the meeting breaks up, make sure that someone takes the cards and puts them up on the team board. The team also needs to take note of what stories are planned along with the initial estimates so they have a baseline they can use when calculating their velocity.

### 8 Keeping It Visible

Help the team set up a team board that radiates their plans for all so see.

#### 8.1 The Team Board

Most teams divide their board into columns to indicate progress. The team puts the cards on the team board immediately after planning and moves the cards across the board until they reach the Done column.

**Stories:** All the stories are placed here, in priority order from top to bottom.

**Tasks:** Tasks are put here, in swim lanes next to the story to which they relate.

**In progress:** When work on a task begins, it is moved into this column.

**Awaiting QA:** When all the tasks are complete, the story card is placed into this column, and the completed tasks can be discarded. Seeing a card here prompts a customer or a tester to check the work and confirm it meets the story tests.

If a problem needs fixing, move the story card back to the Stories column and create new task cards for the fix.

**Done:** The goal is to get all stories that are done over here. This column should steadily fill up over the iteration.

The team delivers value only when a whole story is complete. Encourage them to focus on getting a few stories all the way across the board at a time.

Take care that the board is laid out so that it is clear and legible. Use consistent formatting.

##### Who's Working on What?

The beauty of a team board is that it enables the team to choose their own work. This encourages each team member to take responsibility for making the iteration a success rather than just focusing on "their" part.

Make this visible by asking the team to tag the task they are working on with their name or picture.

##### Choosing Materials

The team board needs to be easy to use and interact with. Keep spare supplies by the board.

**Involve the team in choosing materials.**

##### Electronic Boards

People like tangible thinkgs, and cards are easier to interact with in a group than electronic data. Without the physical constraints of a team board, electronic boards tend to get overcomplicated.

#### 8.2 Big Visible Charts

Increase the visibility of issues they want to track and then post it to the team board.

**Retire chard when the problem has gone.**

Note that as a coach, you need to take care introducing visible charts--get the permission from the team first.

##### Burndown and Burnup Charts

A burndown chart shows how much work is left to do in the iteration.

A release burnup chart plots the number of complete story points across the iterations to the next release.

#### 8.3 Maintaining the Team Board

Stale data isn't useful. Take a few minutes after the daily standup to update the board. Take turns as tracker for the week. Clear the board at the end of every iteration.

#### 8.4 Hurdles

The following are some hurdles you may encounter.

##### No Space for a Team Board

Be creative.

##### Team Doesn't Update Their Board

Make sure board is referenced in daily standup and iteration demos so the team sees it as relevant.

##### Concern That Cards Will Be Lost

To avoid the mild inconvenience of losing a task, use the best materials you can to construct the board.

#### 8.5 Checklist

* Involve the team in designing and constructing a team board so they can make their iteration plan visible. This makes it easy for everyone to see what needs to be done and coordinate their work.
* It's the team's board, so they can use it to post personal stuff and charts that help them focus on improving the way they work.
* Find a board configuration that works for the team. Select materials that make it easy to read from a distance. If you use a color scheme, then provide a key to explain what the colors mean.
* Encourage the team to tag the cards they're working on with names or avatars. This helps make it more visible when someone is blocked.
* Don't bury information in electronic information fridges. However, if you have remote team members or the team is workin as part of a large program, the team will need to create an electronic summary of their iteration plan.
* Use iteration burndown charts only as a crude measure of team confidence that they're on track. Encourage the team to update this themselves at the daily standup or by nominating a tracker. A release burnup chart will be a better indication of progress and helps the customer spot whether they need to descope or budget more iterations.
* Clear the board at the end of the iteration. Review visible charts during the iteration, and retire them when the team no longer finds them useful.

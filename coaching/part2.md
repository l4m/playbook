## II Planning as a Team

### 5 Daily Standup

* What did I do yesterday?
* What will I do today?
* What is in my way?

These questions are a good start. You want the team to adopt the daily standup as their own meeting; it's where they decide who's working on what, and it encourages them to self-organize.

The daily standup reveals how well team members are working together. When it is quick, high-energy, and self-managed, then the team is on the right track.

#### 5.1 Standing Up

The meeting takes less time when everyone is on their feet in the team workspace around the board. If they are reluctant run an experiment for a couple of weeks.

#### 5.2 For the Team by the Team

It is essential to get the message across to the team that their daily standup is for them to synchronize their work. It is not help for a project manager or team lead to gather progress from the team or give feedback on their work. Encourage the team to direct their answers toward other team members.

Keep conversation focused on work in the plan. Not personal details or other projects. Nudge conversations along with one of the three questions if a person hesitates.

##### Establishing a Team Focus

If you notice that team members continue to treat the meeting as a report to you, come right out and say, "Please, can you direct your replies to the whole team? The daily standup is for you all to work out what you need to do today, not me."

Avoid giving praise, saying "Great!" or even "Thank you" after someone lets the team know what they completed.

##### Team Controls the Flow

A speaking token may help keep meetings flowing. The person holding the token becomes more aware of the rest of the team waiting.

Talk about the progress on tasks rather than giving exhaustive accounts of what they did yesterday. Do not try to solve every problem as it comes up.

##### Who Takes Part

The whole team comes to daily standup: developers, testers, designers, customers, Agile coach, and so on. The focus should be work in the current plan. Make sure conversations can be followed by the whole team.

#### 5.3 Handling Issues

Leave the discussion on how to solve blockers until the end of the daily standup. Move on once the problem is understood. The team won't have the full picture until everyone has spoken, and each issue may not require the whole team to solve it.

Write items requiring follow-up on a whiteboard that everyone can see to create a parking lot for issues. Prioritize parking lot at end of meeting and work out who needs to be involved in any follow-up. Issues addressed can be wiped off once resolved.

The daily standup should not be a substitute for other meetings. If it throws up the need for a longer discussion with the whole team, suggest the team arranges a meeting to cover it rather than tacking on a conversation to the end of their daily standup.

Check dependencies on items outside the team and incorporate reminders to follow-up.

#### 5.4 Setting the Time

Most teams prefer to have the daily standup at the start of the working day to discuss who's working on what before getting immersed in their work.

Find a time that works for everyone and make it a team decision. Encourage the team to experiment with different approaches until they find a good compromise.

#### 5.5 When to Coach

The coach acts as the conscience of the team. Gently remind the team about what they planned to do if they're straying from it. There's a real art to this; you don't want to come across as nagging. Wait until they're actually drifting; then make an observation that what you see them doing is different that what they planned. Ask them whether it's really a problem, and if so, how they're planning to handle it.

Remind the team about how many days before the next demo or release and ask them to check that the team board reflects what they're working on now.

They need to take time, during each iteration, to work with their customer to get user stories ready for the next planning session. They also need to follow up on actions from their retrospective and get those done by the end of the iteration.

As a coach, keep an inquiring mind, and be on the lookout for opportunities for improvement. The daily standup often reveals areas where team members need coaching support.

* Is everyone engaged, motivated, and excited?
* Are they making progress and working on high-priority tasks?
* Are they working together and helping each other?
* Are they able to concentrate and do their job without interruptions?

#### 5.6 Hurdles

The following are some hurdles you may encounter.

##### People Arriving Late for the Meeting

Don't repeat information as latecomers arrive. Help them become aware of their behavior, because this can be enough to trigger a change.

##### Meetings Take Too Long

If the daily standup regularly takes more than fifteen minutes, look for ways to speed it up. Cover only what is relevant for teammates to get the big picture. It is difficult to create a sense of ownership with a large team. When people start caring about their own tasks, teamwork starts to break down.

##### Daily Standup is Hijacked

Recommend they talk with the customer about their requests, so these can be considered in the next planning meeting. The remedy lies in education about how Agile works.

##### The Team Isn't Working on the Planned Tasks

Encourage the team to add cards to represent new tasks on the team board so it's clear what they current plan is. Also remind them to remove any tasks that they're not planning to do anymore. 

Work with the customer to establish a budget for support and tracking how much time is being spent on support against that.

##### Daily Standup Isn't Wanted

Check to make sure individuals are making progress. Discuss team concerns in the retrospective.

##### Not Everyone Can Stand

You don't want a person to end up in the center of the circle or outside it. Consider running the daily standup as a sit down meeting so everyone is on the same level, but be aware that if you sit down, it's likely to take loner.

#### 5.7 Checklist

* Find a space that the team can run their daily standup around their team board. If they don't have room in their workspace, then use a portable team board.
* Make the time that the daily standup runs a team decision. You can run it more than once a day, if not everyone works the same hours.
* Encourage the team to keep their replies short and sweet. The three-question formula can help the team get started, but don't let this become a straightjacket for daily standup conversation.
* Keep the daily standup flowing; a speaking token puts this in control of the team.
* Ask the customer along to the daily standup to give her progress and updates.
* Gather issues that come up on a whiteboard where everyone can see the. Prioritize it with the team, and follow up afterward.
* Review the effectiveness of the daily standup in the retrospective, and experiment with the format.

## II Planning as a Team

### 5 Daily Standup

* What did I do yesterday?
* What will I do today?
* What is in my way?

These questions are a good start. You want the team to adopt the daily standup as their own meeting; it's where they decide who's working on what, and it encourages them to self-organize.

The daily standup reveals how well team members are working together. When it is quick, high-energy, and self-managed, then the team is on the right track.

#### 5.1 Standing Up

The meeting takes less time when everyone is on their feet in the team workspace around the board. If they are reluctant run an experiment for a couple of weeks.

#### 5.2 For the Team by the Team

It is essential to get the message across to the team that their daily standup is for them to synchronize their work. It is not help for a project manager or team lead to gather progress from the team or give feedback on their work. Encourage the team to direct their answers toward other team members.

Keep conversation focused on work in the plan. Not personal details or other projects. Nudge conversations along with one of the three questions if a person hesitates.

##### Establishing a Team Focus

If you notice that team members continue to treat the meeting as a report to you, come right out and say, "Please, can you direct your replies to the whole team? The daily standup is for you all to work out what you need to do today, not me."

Avoid giving praise, saying "Great!" or even "Thank you" after someone lets the team know what they completed.

##### Team Controls the Flow

A speaking token may help keep meetings flowing. The person holding the token becomes more aware of the rest of the team waiting.

Talk about the progress on tasks rather than giving exhaustive accounts of what they did yesterday. Do not try to solve every problem as it comes up.

##### Who Takes Part

The whole team comes to daily standup: developers, testers, designers, customers, Agile coach, and so on. The focus should be work in the current plan. Make sure conversations can be followed by the whole team.

#### 5.3 Handling Issues

Leave the discussion on how to solve blockers until the end of the daily standup. Move on once the problem is understood. The team won't have the full picture until everyone has spoken, and each issue may not require the whole team to solve it.

Write items requiring follow-up on a whiteboard that everyone can see to create a parking lot for issues. Prioritize parking lot at end of meeting and work out who needs to be involved in any follow-up. Issues addressed can be wiped off once resolved.

The daily standup should not be a substitute for other meetings. If it throws up the need for a longer discussion with the whole team, suggest the team arranges a meeting to cover it rather than tacking on a conversation to the end of their daily standup.

Check dependencies on items outside the team and incorporate reminders to follow-up.

#### 5.4 Setting the Time

Most teams prefer to have the daily standup at the start of the working day to discuss who's working on what before getting immersed in their work.

Find a time that works for everyone and make it a team decision. Encourage the team to experiment with different approaches until they find a good compromise.

#### 5.5 When to Coach

The coach acts as the conscience of the team. Gently remind the team about what they planned to do if they're straying from it. There's a real art to this; you don't want to come across as nagging. Wait until they're actually drifting; then make an observation that what you see them doing is different that what they planned. Ask them whether it's really a problem, and if so, how they're planning to handle it.

Remind the team about how many days before the next demo or release and ask them to check that the team board reflects what they're working on now.

They need to take time, during each iteration, to work with their customer to get user stories ready for the next planning session. They also need to follow up on actions from their retrospective and get those done by the end of the iteration.

As a coach, keep an inquiring mind, and be on the lookout for opportunities for improvement. The daily standup often reveals areas where team members need coaching support.

* Is everyone engaged, motivated, and excited?
* Are they making progress and working on high-priority tasks?
* Are they working together and helping each other?
* Are they able to concentrate and do their job without interruptions?

#### 5.6 Hurdles

The following are some hurdles you may encounter.

##### People Arriving Late for the Meeting

Don't repeat information as latecomers arrive. Help them become aware of their behavior, because this can be enough to trigger a change.

##### Meetings Take Too Long

If the daily standup regularly takes more than fifteen minutes, look for ways to speed it up. Cover only what is relevant for teammates to get the big picture. It is difficult to create a sense of ownership with a large team. When people start caring about their own tasks, teamwork starts to break down.

##### Daily Standup is Hijacked

Recommend they talk with the customer about their requests, so these can be considered in the next planning meeting. The remedy lies in education about how Agile works.

##### The Team Isn't Working on the Planned Tasks

Encourage the team to add cards to represent new tasks on the team board so it's clear what they current plan is. Also remind them to remove any tasks that they're not planning to do anymore. 

Work with the customer to establish a budget for support and tracking how much time is being spent on support against that.

##### Daily Standup Isn't Wanted

Check to make sure individuals are making progress. Discuss team concerns in the retrospective.

##### Not Everyone Can Stand

You don't want a person to end up in the center of the circle or outside it. Consider running the daily standup as a sit down meeting so everyone is on the same level, but be aware that if you sit down, it's likely to take loner.

#### 5.7 Checklist

* Find a space that the team can run their daily standup around their team board. If they don't have room in their workspace, then use a portable team board.
* Make the time that the daily standup runs a team decision. You can run it more than once a day, if not everyone works the same hours.
* Encourage the team to keep their replies short and sweet. The three-question formula can help the team get started, but don't let this become a straightjacket for daily standup conversation.
* Keep the daily standup flowing; a speaking token puts this in control of the team.
* Ask the customer along to the daily standup to give her progress and updates.
* Gather issues that come up on a whiteboard where everyone can see the. Prioritize it with the team, and follow up afterward.
* Review the effectiveness of the daily standup in the retrospective, and experiment with the format.

### 6 Understanding What to Build

To deliver valuable software, understand both user and business benefits.

User stories underpin all the work an Agile team does--they're the basis of plans, development, and testing. The whole point of user stories is to ask questions to better understand what users need and to find ways of breaking requirements down.

#### 6.1 Life Cycle of a User Story

Idea > Conversation > Cases > Tests > Feedback

Help the team understand that a user story evolves from one artifact into another over time through conversation with the customer. Encourage the team to keep asking questions to refine their understanding of what to implement.

##### Card, Conversation, Confirmation (3Cs)

**Card:** Writing stories on index cards to facilitate group conversations

**Conversation:** Asking questions and suggesting ways to split the story

**Confirmation:** Agreeing on what will be the tests uses to asses whether the story is complete

#### 6.2 Encouraging Conversations

It's the conversations about user stories that enable the team to understand what needs to be built. These conversations need to be driven by developers and testers, checking with the customer what they have understood they story details as they implement it.

New stories and future iterations are worked out in smaller groups with a customer and a couple of developers or a tester.

#### 6.3 Working With Cards

Record conversations about user stories with index cards or sticky notes. They are easier to group and move around when they are physical.

* Demonstrate writing cards, and then stop.
* When someone suggests a new idea, invite them to write their own card.
* As the story being discussed changes, add notes to the card.

Make it easy for the team to use cards any time, not just in planning meetings. Use a consistent layout:

* Title
* Story
* Effort

##### Story Templates

"As a…user, I want…capability so that…benefit."

This template helps the team remember to clarify who the user is and what the benefit of developing the story is.

Develop personas for different user roles. Arrange for the team to go out and meet real users in the setting that the software will be used in.

The purpose of a story template is to help the team learn to ask questions that improve their understanding. Always write the user story in language that can be understood by the whole team including the customer.

After the stories have been implemented as working software, the team relies on the tests, not the cards, for details about the story.

#### 6.4 Confirming the Details

Agree on what behaviors to implement. Pin down the scope of each story as a set of tests that need to pass for the story to be considered "done." These story tests (acceptance criteria) help the team clarify what needs to be built and how much work needs to be done.

Story tests start life as bullet points scribbled on the back of a story card. Advise the team this is enough detail until the point that the story is planned into their next iteration. Later, these notes are used during the iteration as the basis for writing runnable test scripts.

Team draws out story tests by walking through real examples. Examples help the team check that they understand what the software has to do and what behavior will meet customer needs. Examples also lead the team to explore situations that might need error handling.

Start by walking through a simple user interaction where a user achieves a goal. Now encourage the team to ask their customer questions like these:

* What data does the user enter?
* What does the user expect to see?
* Are there business rules that we need to be aware of?

Sketches of the user interface may help; rough pencil drawins are fine. It's the content and interaction that the team needs to understand, no the appearance.

Now prompt the team to ask about what could go wrong. 

User stories are a simple technique that a team can use for understanding their customer through talking about what users need. Show them how to use cards, and encourage them to get involved in conversations about user stories to offer their ideas and to draw out more details as story tests.

#### 6.5 Hurdles

The follow are some hurdles you may encounter.

##### No User-Facing Functionality

If you are working on a project to rework infrastructure or architecture, there is often no obvious user-facing functionality to describe.

User stories can also be used to wrap a bunch of technical tasks into a more meaningful description.

##### Requirements Must Be Documented

Take photos of cards, sketches and boards.

##### Team Can't Meet Up

Use some basic software that allows you to write virtual sticky notes instead of index cards.

#### 6.6 Checklist

* Teach the team the "Card, Conversation, Confirmation" mantra to help them remember that a user story has three essential elements: a conversation, a card, and a confirmation. Encourage the team to refine each user story through conversation with the customer.
* Show the team how to write story cards by doing it yourself and then stopping to make room for the team to write them instead.
* Make sure cards or ntes are available in the team space and in meetings to discuss stories.
* "As a…user I want…capability so that…benefit" can be a useful template for user stories. Watch this does not become a form-filling exercise; such templates should prompt the team to ask questions. Once they're asking the right questions, the team can drop the template.
* Suport the customer in working out details of stories before planning sessions. It helps shape the user stories if you get a few team members involved; they can ask questions and suggest story tests.

## IV Listening to Feedback

### 12 Demonstrating Results

Having a demo motivates them to get everything done in time. The iteration demo builds trust and accountability between the team and the business.

#### 12.1 Preparing for the Demo

Encourage the team to figure out who user stories can be demonstrated to stakeholders.

##### Who Attends the Demo

* Team
* Managers
* Organization

Customer can invite specific stakeholders. Brief stakeholders on the iterative process and what they will see is not the finished product.

##### Finalizing the Running Order

* Clarify which stories are complete and ready to demo.
* Decide on a running order for presenting the stories.
* Agree who will be presenting which stories.
* Organize a run-through to rehearse the demo.

Some teams also put a visible timetable up in their workspace to remind them what needs to be done to prepare. As an Agile coach you are working toward the team taking responsibility and getting themselves ready.

##### Technical Setup

* Make sure software runs in the environment where presented.
* Demonstrate software from a clean integration environment that has been tested.
* Compile a crib sheet on a wiki page listing locations of key resources, such as links and filenames, which will be used in the demo.

Before the meeting starts, do the following:

* Set up any equipment required for the demo, such as a projector, a conference phone, and marker pens.
* Check network connections.
* Remind the team that the meeting is about to start.

#### 12.1 Everyone Plays a Part

Start the meeting with an introduction from the customer. She gives an overview of the goal of the iteration and the user stories that were chosen for development.

The team should let everyone know the running order and whether there are any important stories that are not ready yet. The team can discuss why a shortfall occurred after demonstrating the software or defer this until their next iteration.

Encourage everyone to present but it should be a team decision.

Ensure that feedback, both positive and negative, is captured.

Before the meeting ends, review the main points of feedback with the group to check that none as been missed. Suggestions for enhancements or new features should be included in future planning sessions.

Before closing the meeting, take a last opportunity to agree on what team velocity should be recorded.

* Create new user stories for improvements suggested in the demo.
* Encourage the team to celebrate what they have achieved.
* Discuss what went wrong in the retrospective.

#### 12.3 Releasing the Software

A decision needs to be made about whether the software is ready for release.

The team needs to get together with their customer and check the following items:

* Has the software been tested adequately?
* Are there any showstopper bugs?
* Is this a good time for end users to get a new release?
* Has the relevant documentation been done?
* Does the team need to nominate a team member to support the release?
* Can the release be rolled back if problems are encountered?

Encourage the team to automate their deployment process as much as they can. Deployment tests check that any preconditions that must be in place for the software to run.

#### 12.4 Hurdles

The following are some hurdles you may encounter.

##### The Software Doesn't Work in the Demo

Check that the software works in the meeting room before the demo and that the meeting room computer has all the necessary hardware and software.

##### No Stories Have Been Completed

Canceling the demo sends a signal to the team and to stakeholders that it is not important to deliver working software at the end of every iteration.

Encourage the team to be open about the situation, and make an offer to show the product as is.

Reasons for the shortfall should be discussed in the iteration retrospective.

##### Demo Relies on Software from Other Teams

If possible, hold a joint demonstration so everyone gets to see the product as a whole.

##### Our Software Has No User Interface

Encourage the team to create visualization of data processing to make some sort of demonstration possible.

#### 12.5 Checklist

* Work with the team in planning to ensure user stories can be demonstrated.
* Make sure the whole team, including the customer, attends the demo. Encourage the customer to invite stakeholders from the wider organization along to the demo. Brief any stakeholders who are new to Agile that what they'll be seeing isn't the final product.
* Remind the team on the last day of the iteration to review what is and is not ready for the demo. Suggest that the team put up a visible timetable that covers what the team needs to do to prepare for the demo. The team decides who will demonstrate each story--often this is agreed at the daily standup.
* Help the team avoid having technical glitches spoil the demo. Recommend the team sets up the room in advance and checks network connections. The team can even hold a rehearsal to make the demo really slick.
* Take notes on stakeholder reactions and feedback during the meeting. Review these feedback points with everyone before the meeting ends. Make sure the team captures this feedback as new user stories and takes them along to their next iteration planning session.
* As well as demonstrating working software in the iteration demo, the team agrees with the customer which stories meet their definition of "done" to calculate their final velocity.
* Encourage the team to automate both deployment and testing the deployment so releasing software can be done swiftly without errors.
* Celebrate the team's success after the demo. If things didn't go so well in the demo, discuss this in the retrospective, and work out actions with the team to avoid this the next time around.

### 13 Driving Change with Retrospectives

> Without retrospectives you will find that the team keeps making the same mistakes over and over again.

The retrospective provides a way for you to engage the team members in improving their process in direct response to problems that they face.

#### 13.1 Facilitating a Retrospective

It takes practice to get good a facilitating retrospectives; it helps to get clear on the underlying structure so you can help focus conversations on learning and improvements.

An iteration retrospective should help the team explore the following:

* What insights do they have from the last iteration?
* What areas do they want to focus on improving?
* What ideas can they act on in the next iteration?

Consider the retrospective as a bridge between the past iteration and future iterations. Spend half the retrospective looking back over the past iteration to uncover insights about what happened and why. Then shift into forward gear to come up with ideas to change things for the better and to develop action plans to implement the ideas.

##### Looking Back

Review what was learned in the last iteration. Share individual stories about what happened. Take time to hear what everyone has to say.

Creating a timeline helps piece together a complete picture of events. You may want to include a way for the team to indicate how they felt about the events. Here are some ways to do this:

**Color timeline** Use a scheme of different-colored sticky notes on the timeline to indicate feelings. Use green notes for events that were enjoyable, pink for stressful, and yellow for neutral. Post a key next to the timeline so it's clear what the colors mean. Don't forget to check whether everyone in the group can distinguish between to colors you're using before trying this.

**Emotions seismograph** Invite the team to draw lines reflecting their mood over the iteration. This allows you to see how everyone was feeling at a certain time. And you can spot patterns when the whole team felt eneergized--or despondent.

**Art gallery** Ask the team to draw a picture of what they project felt like to them, and post these pictures on the wall in the meeting. Then give each person an opportunity to explain their drawing.

###### Retrospective Smells

Here are some "smells" that indicate the retrospective isn't working:

**Ideas fest** The team members are asked to call out ideas, without discussing what happened in the last iteration. This doesn't work because problems are glossed over. Actions may not be connected to resolving problems and tend to be about trying out cool stuff rather than fixing what's not working.

**History lesson** This retrospective is rather like an archaeological dig that results only in lists of "What Went Well" and "What Needs Improvement" but no actions. This can improve communication as the team gradually understands what's happening. But because there's no discussion about how to improve, change is left to individuals rather than planned into the next iteration.

**Change the world** The team commits to an ambitious list of actions without considering whether it has time to get them done in the next iteration. This leads to disappointment because the actions don't get done and the team adds more actions to this list every retrospective.

**Wishful thinking** Actions discussed are rather vague with no owners, such as "Improve communication" or "Do more refactoring." These are not actions; they are problems to work on. Without more discussion, the team doesn't really know what to do to implement these pseudoactions.

**No time to improve** The team takes five to ten minutes after their iteration demo to have a quick chat about how things have been going and calls that a retrospective. If individuals do have ideas for improvement, then they face a struggle to implement them without a forum to get support from the team.

**Hot air** The team spends the retrospective grumbling about how bad things are without taking responsibility for improving the situation. This may be cathartic and release tension in the team but can easily turn into a blame game. Retrospectives are about making changes for the better, and this can't happen without some discussion of what the team can do.

##### Mining for Gold

Now we need to draw out insights from the experience gained last iteration. Try digging down to underlying causes. Show differences in how the iteration was experienced by different roles. 

Select the most important topics to focus on using dot voting. Shift into looking forward for process improvements the team can make in the next iteration.

##### Looking Forward

The second half of the retrospective looks forward to the next iteration. This is when the team works out what they'd like to change about their process.

Take time to review what happened on the actions from the last retrospective.

Before deciding any actions, work out with the team how much of their time in the next iteration they can dedicate to process improvements while continuing to develop software.

##### Taking Baby Steps

Identify a problem or an aspirational goal, then decide what smaller action steps are required to get it done.

You may need to understand a problem before you can fix it, so the team may need to start with actions to explore the problem and gather data.

To create actions that will stick, it's not enough to identify what needs to happen; the team also needs to agree on how the changes will be implemented.

Here's the basic process:

1. Ask each team member to work on their own to write a list of actions that they would like the team to make.
2. Next the team works in pairs to combine their lists into a consolidated shortlist.
3. Then the pairs join up with other pairs to further reduce their lists.
4. Eventually the team has a shortlist of actions that have been refined by the whole group.

Once you have a set of actions that the whole team is happy with, you can wrap up the meeting.

#### 13.2 Designing a Retrospective

The hardest bit is usually working out the agenda.

You can suggest different activities to the team to help them:

* Reveal insights
* Agree on a focus for process improvement
* Enable creative problem solving

Decide how long you will need for the retrospective based on iteration length.

Here's an example of how to break down the time:

* Review the goal of meeting, and remind the team of the ground rules (5 minutes).
* Create a timeline (15 minutes).
* Mine the timeline for insights (15 minutes).
* Select the topics to focus on (10 minutes).
* Review the progress on previous actions (5 minutes).
* Generate ideas for improvements (15 minutes).
* Action planning (15 minutes).

##### Prime Detective

Basic Ground Rules

* No laptops
* Phones silent
* Take turns to speak

Prime directive is a special groundrule that underpins all retrospectives.

> Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.

###### Make it safe to explore what went wrong

People learn more from exploring real situations where mistakes were made than studying best practices.

Retrospectives are not the best place to discuss individual performance issues. Steer the conversation away from blame and criticism.

The prime directive also helps counter fundamental attribution error, which is the human tendency to explain the actions of other people as deliberate choice and downplay the situational factors.

By framing previous action and decisions as reasonable at the time (given the situation), the prime directive frees up discussion about doing things differently next time.

Post the prime directive on the wall and explain it to the team. If the conversation starts getting too negative, then you can remind the team to think about the situational forces at work rather than blaming individuals.

#### 13.3 Broader Retrospectives

Issues outside the team need to run a retrospective with a broader focus to look at the bigger picture. Look back over several iterations with a larger group. A good time to hold these retrospectives is after a major software release, so they're often called release retrospectives.

For a retrospective that looks back over many months, some prework is needed--you need to do some digging so you can provide the team with reminders of what happened. Bring what stories were worked on, and print key project artifacts such as burn charts or wiki pages.

##### Retrospective Prework

Here's an example of a survey we have sent out to participants before the retrospective to collect the issues they want to discuss:

To help me work out the best format for the retrospective, I would appreciate if you would send me an email answering the following questions:

* For you, what are the top three topics that need to be discussed?
* Looking back, are there any high points that stand out for you?
* Where there any particular events that are still a puzzle for you?
* What reservations or concerns do you have about this retrospective?
* What impact do you hope this retrospective will have?

Your answers will be kept in strict confidence. I will review everyone's comments and identify common themes, but no individual response will be shared with the group.


#### 13.4 Hurdles

THe following are some hurdles you may encounter.

##### Same Actions Come Up

This is usually caused by not splitting the actions down into tasks that can be achieved in a single iteration.

##### Silent Team Members

Experiment with round-robin discussion, inviting an opinion from each team member in turn.

##### Team Is Always Moaning

Try to get the team back into learning mode by asking, "If this situation happens again, how should we react to it?"

##### Staying Neutral

Be careful not to take sides or play favorites and keep you own impressions about past events and brainstorming involvement to a minimum.

#### 13.5 Checklist

* Start the retrospective by looking back to understand what happened and why. Allow enough time for the team to tell the full story.
* Spend the second half of the retrospective looking forward and deciding on a plan of action.
* Watch out for retrospective "smells" that are stopping your teams retrospectives from being effective. If the retrospectives aren't driving process improvement, think about how you could run them better.
* Find out what problems the team wants to fix most. Use dot voting to focus on what the team has energy to work on.
* Don't commit to more actions that can be completed before the next retrospective. Even two or three actions completed every iteration can have significant impact over several months.
* If the actions from last retrospective weren't done, find out why before adding any more.

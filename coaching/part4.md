## IV Listening to Feedback

### 12 Demonstrating Results

Having a demo motivates them to get everything done in time. The iteration demo builds trust and accountability between the team and the business.

#### 12.1 Preparing for the Demo

Encourage the team to figure out who user stories can be demonstrated to stakeholders.

##### Who Attends the Demo

* Team
* Managers
* Organization

Customer can invite specific stakeholders. Brief stakeholders on the iterative process and what they will see is not the finished product.

##### Finalizing the Running Order

* Clarify which stories are complete and ready to demo.
* Decide on a running order for presenting the stories.
* Agree who will be presenting which stories.
* Organize a run-through to rehearse the demo.

Some teams also put a visible timetable up in their workspace to remind them what needs to be done to prepare. As an Agile coach you are working toward the team taking responsibility and getting themselves ready.

##### Technical Setup

* Make sure software runs in the environment where presented.
* Demonstrate software from a clean integration environment that has been tested.
* Compile a crib sheet on a wiki page listing locations of key resources, such as links and filenames, which will be used in the demo.

Before the meeting starts, do the following:

* Set up any equipment required for the demo, such as a projector, a conference phone, and marker pens.
* Check network connections.
* Remind the team that the meeting is about to start.

#### 12.1 Everyone Plays a Part

Start the meeting with an introduction from the customer. She gives an overview of the goal of the iteration and the user stories that were chosen for development.

The team should let everyone know the running order and whether there are any important stories that are not ready yet. The team can discuss why a shortfall occurred after demonstrating the software or defer this until their next iteration.

Encourage everyone to present but it should be a team decision.

Ensure that feedback, both positive and negative, is captured.

Before the meeting ends, review the main points of feedback with the group to check that none as been missed. Suggestions for enhancements or new features should be included in future planning sessions.

Before closing the meeting, take a last opportunity to agree on what team velocity should be recorded.

* Create new user stories for improvements suggested in the demo.
* Encourage the team to celebrate what they have achieved.
* Discuss what went wrong in the retrospective.

#### 12.3 Releasing the Software

A decision needs to be made about whether the software is ready for release.

The team needs to get together with their customer and check the following items:

* Has the software been tested adequately?
* Are there any showstopper bugs?
* Is this a good time for end users to get a new release?
* Has the relevant documentation been done?
* Does the team need to nominate a team member to support the release?
* Can the release be rolled back if problems are encountered?

Encourage the team to automate their deployment process as much as they can. Deployment tests check that any preconditions that must be in place for the software to run.

#### 12.4 Hurdles

The following are some hurdles you may encounter.

##### The Software Doesn't Work in the Demo

Check that the software works in the meeting room before the demo and that the meeting room computer has all the necessary hardware and software.

##### No Stories Have Been Completed

Canceling the demo sends a signal to the team and to stakeholders that it is not important to deliver working software at the end of every iteration.

Encourage the team to be open about the situation, and make an offer to show the product as is.

Reasons for the shortfall should be discussed in the iteration retrospective.

##### Demo Relies on Software from Other Teams

If possible, hold a joint demonstration so everyone gets to see the product as a whole.

##### Our Software Has No User Interface

Encourage the team to create visualization of data processing to make some sort of demonstration possible.

#### 12.5 Checklist

* Work with the team in planning to ensure user stories can be demonstrated.
* Make sure the whole team, including the customer, attends the demo. Encourage the customer to invite stakeholders from the wider organization along to the demo. Brief any stakeholders who are new to Agile that what they'll be seeing isn't the final product.
* Remind the team on the last day of the iteration to review what is and is not ready for the demo. Suggest that the team put up a visible timetable that covers what the team needs to do to prepare for the demo. The team decides who will demonstrate each story--often this is agreed at the daily standup.
* Help the team avoid having technical glitches spoil the demo. Recommend the team sets up the room in advance and checks network connections. The team can even hold a rehearsal to make the demo really slick.
* Take notes on stakeholder reactions and feedback during the meeting. Review these feedback points with everyone before the meeting ends. Make sure the team captures this feedback as new user stories and takes them along to their next iteration planning session.
* As well as demonstrating working software in the iteration demo, the team agrees with the customer which stories meet their definition of "done" to calculate their final velocity.
* Encourage the team to automate both deployment and testing the deployment so releasing software can be done swiftly without errors.
* Celebrate the team's success after the demo. If things didn't go so well in the demo, discuss this in the retrospective, and work out actions with the team to avoid this the next time around.

## Jobs to be done
What does {{persona}} hire {{product}} to do?

### Goal
Find desirable {{outcome}} matching {{vision}}.

## Make your mark
### Straight lines
Warm it up
### Shapes
* Rectangles
* Circles

## Faces
### Nine
Circles (3 rows of 3)
### Two
Dots (eyes)
### Expressions
* Mouths
      * Top: Smiles
      * Middle: Straight
      * Bottom: Frowns      
* Eyebrows

## Matrix

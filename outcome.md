# Art of Storytelling

## ```{outcome}```
Write a value proposition that resonates with customers.

## UVP
* Unique
* Value
* Proposition

We know *who*. Figure out *what*... Not to build!

## Benefits
* *Confidence* real problems
* *Prioritized* customer needs

### Build
Smallest MVP

### Test
Ideas Faster

## Jobs to be done
What does {{persona}} hire {{product}} to do?

### Goal
Find desirable {{outcome}} matching {{vision}}.

## Make your mark
### Straight lines
Warm it up
### Shapes
* Rectangles
* Circles

## Faces
### Nine
Circles (3 rows of 3)
### Two
Dots (eyes)
### Expressions
* Mouths
      * Top: Smiles
      * Middle: Straight
      * Bottom: Frowns      
* Eyebrows
      * Left: None
      * Middle: Tilted up
      * Right: Tilted down

3 Mouths + 2 Eyebrows = 9 Expressions

## Matrix
of human emotion

### Need or Desire
*Sketching* pictures evokes an emotional response.

### Delight
Capture the *moment* {{persona}} loves {{product}}.

### Understanding Emotion
Share assumptions with team and customers.

## Collaboration

Give {{persona}} emotions. Put {{him/her}} in a scene.

### Persona

* Pass
* Put them in a place
    * Line around knee
	* Inside or out
	* Office or store
	* Traffic or tractor
	* Add an object or two

	* Sentence
	* Short expression
* Pass

#### Simple exercise, tells a story.
* *Share* with each other
* *Discuss* amongst yourselves

#### Don't sweat the technique.

## Just Draw
Think later

#### With {{product}} {{persona}} can …{{caption}}. 

* Person (clothespin person)
* Context (where)
* Expression (face)
* Thought (talk bubble)

### Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!
Don't get stuck.

* "Speed kills sensor."
* Emotion > Logic

### Just do it.
* Stop thinking
* Get creative

## 6-up
Fold paper, look at {{persona}}.
#### Sticky: With {{company}} {{persona}} can …{{caption}}.

* *How* can {{persona}} use {{product}}?
* *When* does {{persona}} need {{product}}?
* *Where* is {{persona}}?
* *What* is {{persona}} using {{product}} to solve?

### Envision each sketch
Stories about {{persona}} using {{product}}.

#### Re: Experiences != Technology

### Redraw your last sketch
### Draw 5 more
Take 10 minutes.

#### Each should have:
* Person
* Context
* Expression
* Thought

## Share
Understand others ideas.

* Work at wall
* Line up sketches
* Quiet read
* Group discussion
	* Understand not persuade
	* Ask Questions

#### Have a conversation
Identify the moment {{persona}} falls in love with {{product}}.

* What are the top options?
* Decide which caption captures emotion with dot voting.

## Storyboard
Problem > Solution > Outcome

* What is the problem?
* What do we do?
* What is the result?

Test with {{persona}}.

**Hypothesis:** Interviewing 5 customers like {{persona}} reveals 3 must have {{product}}.

* Gather feedback from 5 interviews.
* Iterate to improve storyboard.

### Sketches not words
Creative thinking
### Dot voting
Quicker decisions

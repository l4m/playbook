# Art of Storytelling

## ```{outcome}```
Write a value proposition that resonates with customers.

## UVP
* Unique
* Value
* Proposition

We know *who*. Figure out *what*... Not to build!

## Benefits
* *Confidence* real problems
* *Prioritized* customer needs

### Build
Smallest MVP

### Test
Ideas Faster

## Jobs to be done
* What does {{persona}} hire {{product}} to do?

### Goal
* Find desirable {{outcome}} matching {{vision}}.

## Make your mark
### Straight lines
Warm it up
### Shapes
* Rectangles
* Circles

## Faces
### Nine
Circles (3 rows of 3)
### Two
Dots (eyes)
### Expressions
* Mouths
      * Top: Smiles
      * Middle: Straight
      * Bottom: Frowns      
* Eyebrows
      * Left: None
      * Middle: Tilted up
      * Right: Tilted down

## Expressions
* *Sketching* pictures with emotions.
* Capture the *moment* {{persona}} loves {{product}}.

Use learnings to write taglines and pitches.

## Matrix
Of human emotions

3 Mouths + 2 Eyebrows = 9 Expressions

### When there is a need or desire
There is an emotional response

### Capture the moment of delight
Understand it. Share understanding with team and customers.

### Emotion of customer

## Collaboration

Give {{persona}} emotions. Put {{him/her}} in a scene.

### Person
* Clothes pin man
* Pass
* Give them an expression
* Pass
* Put them in a place
     * Line around knee
	* Inside or out
	* Office or store
	* In traffic or on a tractor
	* Add an object or two
* Pass

#### Person, Place, Feeling

* Talk bubble: What is on {{his/her}} mind?
	* Sentence
	* Short expression
* Pass

#### Simple exercise, tells a story.
* *Share* with each other
* *Discuss* amongst yourselves

#### Don't sweat the technique.

## Just Draw
Think later

* Person (Clothepin man)
* Context (where)
* Expression (face)
* Thought (talk bubble)
* Caption: With {{product}} {{persona}} can …{{caption}}. 

### Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!
Don't get stuck.

* "Speed kills sensor."
* Emotion > Logic

### Just do it.
* Stop thinking
* Get creative

## 6-up
Fold paper, look at {{persona}}.
#### Sticky: With {{company}} {{persona}} can …{{caption}}.

* *How* can {{persona}} use {{product}}?
* *When* does {{persona}} need {{product}}?
* *Where* is {{persona}}?
* *What* is {{persona}} using {{product}} to solve?

### Envision each sketch
Stories about {{persona}} using {{product}}.

#### Re: Experiences != Technology

### Draw 5 more
Take 10 minutes.

#### Each should have:
* Person
* Context
* Expression
* Thought

Identify the moment {{persona}} falls in love with {{product}}.

## Share
Understand others ideas.

* Work at wall
* Line up sketches
* Quiet read
* Group discussion
	* Understand not persuade
	* Ask Questions

#### Have a conversation
* What are the top options?
* Decide which caption captures emotion with dot voting.

## Storyboard
Problem > Solution > Outcome

* What is the problem?
* What do we do?
* What is the result?

Test with {{persona}}.

**Hypothesis:** 3 out of 5 customers like {{persona}} must have {{product}}.

* Gather feedback from 5 interviews.
* Iterate to improve storyboard.

## Techniques
### Sketches not words
Creative thinking
### Dot voting
Quicker decisions

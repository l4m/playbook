### Welcome (Set the Stage)
(2 minutes)

Briefly set the stage for how the interview works:

I appreciate you taking the time to speak with us today.
We are currently working on a {{product one-liner) for {{Characteristic}}. Our vision is {{vision}}.
Before getting too far ahead of ourselves, we wanted to make sure other {{Group}} share these problems and see whether this was a product worth building.

The interview works like this. I’ll start by describing the main problems we are tackling, then ask if any of those resonate with you.

I would like to stress we do not have a finished product and our objective is learning from you, we are not selling or ptiching anything.

Does that sound good?

### Collect Demographics (Test Customer Segment)
(2 minutes)

Ask introductory questions to collect basic demographics you believe drive this segment and qualify early adopters:

Before we go on to the problems, I would like to learn a little more about you?

#### {{Demographics}}
* How many kids do you have?
* How old are they?
* Do you share photos online?
* Do you share videos online?
* How often?
* With whom?


Be creative in the questions you ask. Sometimes the best way to get quality information is not a direct route.

### Tell a Story (Set Problem Context)
(2 minutes)

Illustrate the top problems with a story:

Great, thank you!
Please let me tell you about the problems we are tackling. {{Story}}

Once we had kids, we found ourselves taking a lot more photos than before, and especially more videos. We also started getting regular requests (as in, weekly) for updates from grandparents and other family members. But we found it difficult to share all this content on a regular basis because the process was too time-consuming and sometimes painful. We had to organize the files, resize them, and babysit the upload process. Video was even more painful because we often had to convert the
video first (transcode it) into a web-friendly format.
Like most other parents, we are sleep-deprived and don’t have as much free time as before. Having kids has given us a whole new appreciation for free time and we’d much rather spend our time doing other things.

Does any of this resonate with you?

### Problem Ranking (Test Problem)
(4 minutes)

State the top three problems and ask your prospects to rank them:

Specifically: {{Problems}}

1. Do you find yourself taking more photos/videos than before?
2. Do you find the photo/video sharing process painful?
3. Are you like most parents in that you don’t have a lot of free time?

Do you have any other issues related to {{Product}} I am currently missing?

### Explore Customer’s Worldview (Test Problem)
(15 minutes)

This is the heart of the interview. The best script here is “no script.”

Go through each problem in turn. Ask the interviewees how they address the problem today. Then sit back and listen.
Let them go into as much detail as they wish. Ask follow-up questions, but do not lead them or try to convince them of the merits of a problem (or solution).

In addition to their raw responses, judge their body language and tone to get a sense of how they’d rate the problem: “must-have,” “nice to have,” or “don’t need.”

If they offer up new problems along the way, explore them the same way.

{{Behaviors}}

1. So, how do you share photos and videos today?
2. Could you walk us through your workflow?
3. What products do you currently use and how did you first hear about them?

Ask any follow-up questions to understand their current workflow. This section is invaluable both for understanding the problems and for confirming the prospects’ earlier problem ranking. Sometimes people unknowingly lie to you during the problem rankings, either because they are being polite or they simply don’t know. Check for that here. If they claim aproblem is a “must-have,” but they aren’t actively doing anything to solve it, there’s a disconnect.

### Wrapping Up (the Hook and Ask)
(2 minutes)

We are done with all of the hypothesis-related questions, but you still have one more thing to do and two more questions to ask. Even though you aren’t ready to talk about your solution in detail, you need to provide a hook to maintain interest.

The high-concept pitch is perfect for this. It not only helps explain your solution at a high level, but also leaves a memorable sound bite that helps the interviewees spread your message.

Then you need to ask for permission to follow up. Your goal is to establish a continuous feedback loop with prospects. And finally, you need to ask the interviewees for referrals to other potential prospects:

As I mentioned at the start, this isn’t a finished product, but we are building a product that will simplify how parents share their photos and videos online. The best way to describe the concept might be “SmugMug without any uploading” (replace “SmugMug” with the
name of the interviewee’s existing service).

Based on what we talked about today, would you be willing to see the product when we have something ready?

Also, we are looking to interview other people like yourself. Could you introduce us to other parents with young kids?

### Document Results
(5 minutes)

Take the five minutes immediately following an interview to document your results while they’re still fresh in your mind. It helps to create a template like the one that follows so that you can quickly jot down the responses to the hypotheses you set out to test.

I recommended earlier that you run the interview with one other person whenever possible to keep the results objective. Each of you should independently fill out the form first. Then have a debriefing session later where
you compare notes and make a final entry into whatever system you use to record your interview results.

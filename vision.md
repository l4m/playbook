# Passion + Purpose

## ```{vision}```
Lay the #cornerstone of your organization.

Truly great companies understand the difference between what should never change and what should be open to iteration. The rare ability to manage continuity and change is closely linked to developing a vision. Vision provides guidance about what core to preserve and what future to stimulate progress toward. 

The vision is what we aspire to achieve and requires significant change and progress to attain.

## Fundamentals
Vision is most critical agreement on the way to product/market fit.

We must uncover the values that drive you, your product and your company. And articulate a purpose that will keep your company focused, credible and unique.

## Getting Started
A pivot is a change in strategy without a change in vision.

Your company has vision and values even if you have never given them a moments thought. We need to clarify what those things are. And use them as guides when encountering the difficult decisions entrepreneurs inevitably face.

We will create a vision pyramid that describes your key values, your product and a company purpose statement. This is a tool to clarify who you are, what you are doing and why you are doing it.

## Benefits
* Forces us to be clear with ourselves and our team about why this company matters.
* Provides a lens for hiring the right kind of people and growing your team with the best contributors.
* Enables pivots without losing the unique assets that make your company valuable.

## Product
On a sticky note, write one sentence that describes your product in 6 words or less.

Write ideas on multiple notes.

Determine which one you like best. And set it to the side.

Look deeply into who you are and why you are doing this startup.

## Values
Values are adjectives and phrases that describe your company.

*Examples:* Creative, Optimistic, Action-Oriented, Passionate, Fast, Integrity, Friendly

What excites your team and makes your company tick?<br>
Think about the adjectives and phrases that describe your company.

What is your company like?<br>
How would someone describe the atmosphere to a friend?

If you are just getting started describe what you hope your company will be like and who you are as a person.

*Example:*
transapi.io
transparent, inquisitive, balanced, creative, fun

What makes your company unique?

We are going to take about 5 minutes to come up with 10 ideas. This is an independent dump and sort. Put one idea on each sticky note.

*Prompt:*
Write down adjectives and phrases that describe your company.

The goal is to push yourself. Come up with more ideas than you are comfortable with. Exhaust the possibilities. In these exercises quantity is better than quality. We want to go broad to get out as many ideas as we can.

## Rank and Select
Take 5 minutes to divide your sticky notes into two piles:

* Everything Else
* 5 Most Important Values

We are going to divide the stickies into two piles and stack rank the most important. I am going to talk through a couple of prompts. As I am talking scan your pile and set the notes that apply off to the right.

*Prompts:*

* Would you quit if the company wasn't like this?
* What items are inescapable?<br>You are going to be like that weather you want to or not.
* Is this unique and can only apply to you?
* Which things are the best of you?<br>What is the company you really want to be?

This should have given you a head start in sorting. Now prioritize the top five that are most important to you and discard everything else.

Take 5 minutes and order your top five values with the most important at the top.

## Combine and Cluster
Arrive a shared understanding and agreement.
Discuss the values with each other, identify patterns and merge any duplicates.

1. Each post 5 values on wall from top to bottom at eye level.
2. Do a quiet read. Go through each list without talking and familiarize yourself with your teammates values.
3. Talk about values together. This is about understanding not challenging. Ask questions and understand each contribution.

This should take no more than five minutes.

## Cluster and Select
Take 10 minutes to name the clusters, eliminate those that are less important, refine the wording.

### Consolidate
* Stack up duplicates
* Make clusters of similar ones

* Name the clusters<br>Write a word or phrase that describes each cluster.
* Eliminate less important items<br>We want to get down to seven words or phrases 
* Refine down to 5 stickies<br>You can remove stickies or reword them for 5 great stickies.

Take 10 minutes to work at the wall and consolidate.

Stack the most important values up, label them Values and put them off to the side.

## Purpose
Of all the things you could be doing, why are you doing this company? There are other startup ideas, most fail anyway, and you could actually get a job. What is special that keeps you committed to this?

In this step we will make a purpose statement.
The purpose statement sends a clear statement about why you exist as a company.

We do not want to pitch. We want the emotional reasons underneath that story. 

* Why are you passionate about what you are working on?
* What do you aspire to do?

These are our Big Hairy Audacious Goals<br>
Not a tagline...but why.

The question the purpose statement serves is, "Why this?"

*Prompt:*
Of all the things you could be doing, why are you doing this company?

Take 5 minutes to answer this question.

## Drill Down
Now we need to get past the obvious to something more subtle and closely held. Take 10 minutes to drill down by asking why and writing down the new answer.

Now answer the following:<br>
My purpose with this company is...

## Collective Purpose
Take 20 minutes to create a statement that represents everyone. 

Explain your purpose statements to each other.
Collectively write a statement that captures what everyone believes.
  Summarize and represent everyone.
	Something everyone can buy into.

Write the statement as your shared purpose.

It does not have to be perfect, just describe why this company matters.

This is challenging but we must settle on a purpose statement before moving forward.

## Pyramid
Take 5 minutes to capture all the work in a visual poster. This can become and information radiator.

Write the purpose statement in the top of the pyramid.
Write your product 1-liner in the middle section.
Write the values in the bottom section

This is a tool for focusing. Read through it and post it on the wall where everyone can see it.
This will give everyone a chance to become aligned on what you are doing and why.

Marketing should see the seed of a brand. This can guide creative decisions moving forward.
Recruiters can use if for screening candidates to determine if they fit within your organization.

## I Coaching Basics

### 1 Starting the Journey

**Mission:** Help teams produce great software by applying agile.

**Learn:**

* Basic coaching skills
* Strategies to implement change

#### 1.1 What does an Agile coach do?
* Grows a productive team that can think for itself.
* Helps unlearn old habits.
* Listens and asks questions to help team improve rather than offering solutions.

Change:

* How they work
* How they think

**Notice:** Keep your eyes and ears open, notice how the team works, and then reflect on underlying causes.

**Feedback:** Give feedback about what you noticed to the team. Help them incorporate feedback into the way they work so they spot problems themselves.

**Educate:** Look for ways to encourage learning. You can do this by demonstrating how to be Agile, by telling stories, and by running training sessions.

**Facilitate:** Make it easy to be Agile by smoothing the path for constructive communication and collaboration.

**Support:** Be there when the team gets stuck, encourage them to keep going, and help them stay energized.

Coaches work one step at a time rather than creating a whirlwind of change.

#### 1.2 Developing a Coaching Attitude
* Believe change is possible
* Stay open to ideas

What a team needs from you is guidance on what they can do and courage to make these changes a reality.

Important habits to develop as an Agile coach:

* Lead by example. Follow Agile principles.
* Keep your balance. It is change not you the team is reacting to.
* Set a realistic pace. Keep pushing gently and persistently.
* Mind your language. Take care of how you talk to them. Show the team you are on their side.
    * **Use:** our/we/us
	* **Not:** I/you/they
	* **Avoid:** never/always/right/wrong
* Learn as you go. Reflect on what happened. Figure out how to improve.

Patience is one of the most important qualities of an Agile coach. Change takes time.

#### 1.3 Getting Ready to Coach
When you have experience as an Agile practitioner, you'll have a better appreciation of how it works, and you can use real examples to illustrate your points.

##### Arrange to be Introduced
Team members need to understand your role as Agile coach.

###### Exercise: Questions to Ask Before Coaching
**Motivation:**

* Why am I coaching this team?
* What difference do I want to make?
* What do I want to learn?

**Skills:**

* What do I have to offer?
* Who do people need to know about me?
* How will I make this information available to the team?

**Responsibilities:**

* Do I need to get anyone's agreement to start coaching?
* What are the responsibilities of my official role?
* Do any of these conflict with being an Agile coach?
* How will I review my progress?
* How will I know when I'm done?

**Support:**

* What support can I get from others?
* How will I be introduced to the team?
* Are there other Agile coaches I need to work with?
* Do I need to communicate progress with coaching to a sponsor?

Being introduced properly helps build credibility and trust with the team, which is essential before they'll listen to you. They need to understand what you can offer them and what support you have from management.

**External coach:** Have sponsor arrange introduction. Make sure they know what credentials are relevant to mention.

**Internal coach:** Senior management should explain drivers and roles of Agile in the organization.

* Get to know people on the team.
* Talk to them about motivation for this project.
* Ask them about their hopes and fears for this project.
* See how they work.

The team needs to build confidence in you ability and experience before they'll be willing to follow your lead. Running an interactive session to learn about Agile is a good way to generate interest.

#### 1.4 How to Start Coaching

* Pick up one thing and jump in
* Brainstorm list of problems
* Prioritize based on mission

##### PrOpER Coach Cycle

**Problem:** Pick a problem to work on. Watch how the team works. What needs to be improved?

**Options:** What could you try that might influence the situation for the better? List at least three options.

**Experiment:** Pick one option to try.

**Review:** Did you improve things? What did you learn?

When trying to come up with options, here are some ideas to consider:

* Surface: Make the problem visible to the team.
* Socialize: Talk with the team about the problem.
* Wait and see: Leave this problem; if it gets worse, the team will probably notice.
* Go sideways: Sell the problem to someone else inside or outside the team.
* Root cause analysis: Look for the root cause of the problem.
* Educate: Provide the team with more information so they see a solution.
* Put them in charge: Hand over responsibility to the team or a team member.

#### 1.5 Maintaining the Pace
* Creating Agile teams takes time.
* Make one small step forward every day.
* Use other coaches to help solve problems.

##### Breaking In Your Coach's Boots

You may find it strange being less hands on and letting the team decide rather than setting direction yourself. It's hard to get time to coach when heavily involved with project tasks. When we play the coach role from the sidelines rather than playing on the field, we can focus completely on improving process and team work.

How can you tell how you're doing as an Agile coach?

* Is the team more Agile than it was a month ago?
* Have you had a positive influence on the team?

Don't expect recognition. A good coach gives credit to the team.

Another sign the team has absorbed your coaching is when they give advice on what you have explained previously. The joy of coaching has to be when you see the team achieve goals without consistently trying to be Agile.

##### Moving On

If we stay with the same team for more than a few months, we can lose our fresh perspective. Move on when the team becomes self-coaching and no longer depends on you for answers.

#### 1.6 Hurdles

##### No Time to Coach
Extract yourself from being the person everyone depends on. Show other people how to do the key tasks they rely on you for.

##### No Experience
* Do not bluff when you do not know the answer.
* Not being an expert can help you stay detached enough from a problem that you can still see it from a fresh perspective.
* Help the team work through the issue by facilitating the discussion and researching what other Agile teams are trying.
	* user groups
	* conferences
	* specialists

##### Blockers to Agile
Sometimes blockers are technical, other times they are organizational.

Address roadblocks before attempting to coach a team in Agile.

#### 1.7 Checklist

* Practice explaining Agile to others.
* Work out the best way to be introduced to the team.
* Find ways to show that you apply Agile principles yourself.
* Apply the PrOpER cycle to your coaching interventions. Start with the problem, consider at least three different options that you can take, pick one and try that as an experiment, and then review the outcome.
* Pause to reflect and learn from your mistakes.
* Look for opportunities to learn from other Agile coaches, both inside and outside your company.
* When the team is running an effective Agile process, it's probably time to move on.

### 2 Working with People

Tap into their expertise to reveal what is holding them back.

#### 2.1 Listening

A coach listens deeply.

**Create space:** Don't chime in and talk about yourself. If there's a pause in the conversation, you don't have to fill the void.

**Be open:** Put on a relaxed and open expression rather than frowning or grinning, which might make them feel you're judging them or not taking them seriously.

**Show interest:** Use your eyes, look into their face, and make eye contact from time to time (without staring intently) to show you're interested in what they're saying.

**Affirm:** Nod your head to show you understand. You can also make "mmm" and "ah" sounds to show you heard them.

* Listen before giving advice.
* Give speaker full attention.
* Understand feelings and needs.
* Ask clarifying questions.
* Do not challenge or criticize.
* Prove you listened by following up.

##### Reading Between the Lines

Focus on the person speaking, notice how they express themselves, and consider their possible motivation for starting the conversation:

* Are they looking to gain support, provide a favor, or repay a favor?
* Are they looking for empathy, advice, or more information?
* Are they flagging a problem because they want you to help them solve it?

Pat attention to any nonverbal cues such as body language and the tone of voice they use:

* Are they upset, angry, excited?
* Do they seem uncomfortable or relaxed about the conversation?
* Are they acting a little different that usual?

##### Maintaining Trust

* Summarize key points and check them with speaker.
* Complete further investigation before committing to a course of action.
* Do not make immediate promises about resolution.
* Check whether they person prefers discussion to remain private.

##### Background Listening

Take notes and quotes for follow-up.

A healthy team buzzes with sporadic conversation when team members are working together to create software. A quiet team may not be working.

Listening provides information about the team and the issues they are struggling with.

#### 2.2 Giving Feedback

* Separate basic information from your feelings.
* Give examples rather than interpretation.
* Make suggestions on how to handle similar situations in the future.
* Let them know you noticed what they did and they positive effects that resulted.

Timely feedback helps nudge the team into improving their process without directing them what to do.

#### 2.3 Resolving Conflicts

If you detect concealed conflict listen to the concerns of individuals. Consider whether the dispute will resolve itself.

##### Nonviolent Communication
* **Observation:** When you…(describe your observation)?
* **Feeling:** Are you feeling…(guess the emotion)?
* **Need:** Because you need…(guess the need)?
* **Request:** Would you like (me, him, her, them) to (specific action)?

Mediators cannot take sides. Understand both. Frame in context of the team. Explain situational factors at play.

Some differences of opinion are healthy. Too much emphasis on peace and harmony signals complacency.

#### 2.4 Building Agreement

Gradient scales run from endorse to block. Identify when there is a lack of consensus. When a person does not agree with an action, they are unlikely to implement it enthusiastically.

##### Fist-to-Five Voting

* Fist is block
* Number of fingers indicate level of support
* Less than 3 fingers should state objections

#### 2.5 Hurdles

##### Emotional Outburst in a Meeting

* Call break and recover composure.
* Understand what has upset him.
* Check with team to determine if issue should be resolved before meeting continues.

##### Lack of People Skills

People have different communication preferences. Some prefer direct, others need space.

##### Cultural Differences

Become attuned to tolerance for ambiguity and individualism.

#### 2.6 Checklist

* Practice deep listening to understand the problems the team faces and build trust. Give your full attention to the person talking, and ask clarifying questions to check that you have understood what they are saying.
* When giving feedback, separate what you saw or heard from your feelings about the situation. Give specific examples of what you noticed rather than general comments. Tell them what you saw or heard, and then ask about their explanation of events. Now put your heads together to come up with ideas for handling the situation next time.
* If a conflict erupts, make sure all sides get to share their view point. Don't step in to resolve every conflict for the team because otherwise they rely on you as a peacemaker rather than learning to get along.
* Use gradients of agreement to reveal the level of support for a change. This allows the team to find out whether there is major or only minor disagreements.

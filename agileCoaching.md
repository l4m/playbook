## I Coaching Basics

### 1 Starting the Journey

**Mission:** Help teams produce great software by applying agile.

**Learn:**

* Basic coaching skills
* Strategies to implement change

#### 1.1 What does an Agile coach do?
* Grows a productive team that can think for itself.
* Helps unlearn old habits.
* Listens and asks questions to help team improve rather than offering solutions.

Change:

* How they work
* How they think

**Notice:** Keep your eyes and ears open, notice how the team works, and then reflect on underlying causes.

**Feedback:** Give feedback about what you noticed to the team. Help them incorporate feedback into the way they work so they spot problems themselves.

**Educate:** Look for ways to encourage learning. You can do this by demonstrating how to be Agile, by telling stories, and by running training sessions.

**Facilitate:** Make it easy to be Agile by smoothing the path for constructive communication and collaboration.

**Support:** Be there when the team gets stuck, encourage them to keep going, and help them stay energized.

Coaches work one step at a time rather than creating a whirlwind of change.

#### 1.2 Developing a Coaching Attitude
* Believe change is possible
* Stay open to ideas

What a team needs from you is guidance on what they can do and courage to make these changes a reality.

Important habits to develop as an Agile coach:

* Lead by example. Follow Agile principles.
* Keep your balance. It is change not you the team is reacting to.
* Set a realistic pace. Keep pushing gently and persistently.
* Mind your language. Take care of how you talk to them. Show the team you are on their side.
    * **Use:** our/we/us
	* **Not:** I/you/they
	* **Avoid:** never/always/right/wrong
* Learn as you go. Reflect on what happened. Figure out how to improve.

Patience is one of the most important qualities of an Agile coach. Change takes time.

#### 1.3 Getting Ready to Coach
When you have experience as an Agile practitioner, you'll have a better appreciation of how it works, and you can use real examples to illustrate your points.

##### Arrange to be Introduced
Team members need to understand your role as Agile coach.

###### Exercise: Questions to Ask Before Coaching
**Motivation:**

* Why am I coaching this team?
* What difference do I want to make?
* What do I want to learn?

**Skills:**

* What do I have to offer?
* Who do people need to know about me?
* How will I make this information available to the team?

**Responsibilities:**

* Do I need to get anyone's agreement to start coaching?
* What are the responsibilities of my official role?
* Do any of these conflict with being an Agile coach?
* How will I review my progress?
* How will I know when I'm done?

**Support:**

* What support can I get from others?
* How will I be introduced to the team?
* Are there other Agile coaches I need to work with?
* Do I need to communicate progress with coaching to a sponsor?

Being introduced properly helps build credibility and trust with the team, which is essential before they'll listen to you. They need to understand what you can offer them and what support you have from management.

**External coach:** Have sponsor arrange introduction. Make sure they know what credentials are relevant to mention.

**Internal coach:** Senior management should explain drivers and roles of Agile in the organization.

* Get to know people on the team.
* Talk to them about motivation for this project.
* Ask them about their hopes and fears for this project.
* See how they work.

The team needs to build confidence in you ability and experience before they'll be willing to follow your lead. Running an interactive session to learn about Agile is a good way to generate interest.

#### 1.4 How to Start Coaching

* Pick up one thing and jump in
* Brainstorm list of problems
* Prioritize based on mission

##### PrOpER Coach Cycle

**Problem:** Pick a problem to work on. Watch how the team works. What needs to be improved?

**Options:** What could you try that might influence the situation for the better? List at least three options.

**Experiment:** Pick one option to try.

**Review:** Did you improve things? What did you learn?

When trying to come up with options, here are some ideas to consider:

* Surface: Make the problem visible to the team.
* Socialize: Talk with the team about the problem.
* Wait and see: Leave this problem; if it gets worse, the team will probably notice.
* Go sideways: Sell the problem to someone else inside or outside the team.
* Root cause analysis: Look for the root cause of the problem.
* Educate: Provide the team with more information so they see a solution.
* Put them in charge: Hand over responsibility to the team or a team member.

#### 1.5 Maintaining the Pace
* Creating Agile teams takes time.
* Make one small step forward every day.
* Use other coaches to help solve problems.

##### Breaking In Your Coach's Boots

You may find it strange being less hands on and letting the team decide rather than setting direction yourself. It's hard to get time to coach when heavily involved with project tasks. When we play the coach role from the sidelines rather than playing on the field, we can focus completely on improving process and team work.

How can you tell how you're doing as an Agile coach?

* Is the team more Agile than it was a month ago?
* Have you had a positive influence on the team?

Don't expect recognition. A good coach gives credit to the team.

Another sign the team has absorbed your coaching is when they give advice on what you have explained previously. The joy of coaching has to be when you see the team achieve goals without consistently trying to be Agile.

##### Moving On

If we stay with the same team for more than a few months, we can lose our fresh perspective. Move on when the team becomes self-coaching and no longer depends on you for answers.

#### 1.6 Hurdles

##### No Time to Coach
Extract yourself from being the person everyone depends on. Show other people how to do the key tasks they rely on you for.

##### No Experience
* Do not bluff when you do not know the answer.
* Not being an expert can help you stay detached enough from a problem that you can still see it from a fresh perspective.
* Help the team work through the issue by facilitating the discussion and researching what other Agile teams are trying.
	* user groups
	* conferences
	* specialists

##### Blockers to Agile
Sometimes blockers are technical, other times they are organizational.

Address roadblocks before attempting to coach a team in Agile.

#### 1.7 Checklist

* Practice explaining Agile to others.
* Work out the best way to be introduced to the team.
* Find ways to show that you apply Agile principles yourself.
* Apply the PrOpER cycle to your coaching interventions. Start with the problem, consider at least three different options that you can take, pick one and try that as an experiment, and then review the outcome.
* Pause to reflect and learn from your mistakes.
* Look for opportunities to learn from other Agile coaches, both inside and outside your company.
* When the team is running an effective Agile process, it's probably time to move on.

### 2 Working with People

Tap into their expertise to reveal what is holding them back.

#### 2.1 Listening

A coach listens deeply.

**Create space:** Don't chime in and talk about yourself. If there's a pause in the conversation, you don't have to fill the void.

**Be open:** Put on a relaxed and open expression rather than frowning or grinning, which might make them feel you're judging them or not taking them seriously.

**Show interest:** Use your eyes, look into their face, and make eye contact from time to time (without staring intently) to show you're interested in what they're saying.

**Affirm:** Nod your head to show you understand. You can also make "mmm" and "ah" sounds to show you heard them.

* Listen before giving advice.
* Give speaker full attention.
* Understand feelings and needs.
* Ask clarifying questions.
* Do not challenge or criticize.
* Prove you listened by following up.

##### Reading Between the Lines

Focus on the person speaking, notice how they express themselves, and consider their possible motivation for starting the conversation:

* Are they looking to gain support, provide a favor, or repay a favor?
* Are they looking for empathy, advice, or more information?
* Are they flagging a problem because they want you to help them solve it?

Pat attention to any nonverbal cues such as body language and the tone of voice they use:

* Are they upset, angry, excited?
* Do they seem uncomfortable or relaxed about the conversation?
* Are they acting a little different that usual?

##### Maintaining Trust

* Summarize key points and check them with speaker.
* Complete further investigation before committing to a course of action.
* Do not make immediate promises about resolution.
* Check whether they person prefers discussion to remain private.

##### Background Listening

Take notes and quotes for follow-up.

A healthy team buzzes with sporadic conversation when team members are working together to create software. A quiet team may not be working.

Listening provides information about the team and the issues they are struggling with.

#### 2.2 Giving Feedback

* Separate basic information from your feelings.
* Give examples rather than interpretation.
* Make suggestions on how to handle similar situations in the future.
* Let them know you noticed what they did and they positive effects that resulted.

Timely feedback helps nudge the team into improving their process without directing them what to do.

#### 2.3 Resolving Conflicts

If you detect concealed conflict listen to the concerns of individuals. Consider whether the dispute will resolve itself.

##### Nonviolent Communication
* **Observation:** When you…(describe your observation)?
* **Feeling:** Are you feeling…(guess the emotion)?
* **Need:** Because you need…(guess the need)?
* **Request:** Would you like (me, him, her, them) to (specific action)?

Mediators cannot take sides. Understand both. Frame in context of the team. Explain situational factors at play.

Some differences of opinion are healthy. Too much emphasis on peace and harmony signals complacency.

#### 2.4 Building Agreement

Gradient scales run from endorse to block. Identify when there is a lack of consensus. When a person does not agree with an action, they are unlikely to implement it enthusiastically.

##### Fist-to-Five Voting

* Fist is block
* Number of fingers indicate level of support
* Less than 3 fingers should state objections

#### 2.5 Hurdles

##### Emotional Outburst in a Meeting

* Call break and recover composure.
* Understand what has upset him.
* Check with team to determine if issue should be resolved before meeting continues.

##### Lack of People Skills

People have different communication preferences. Some prefer direct, others need space.

##### Cultural Differences

Become attuned to tolerance for ambiguity and individualism.

#### 2.6 Checklist

* Practice deep listening to understand the problems the team faces and build trust. Give your full attention to the person talking, and ask clarifying questions to check that you have understood what they are saying.
* When giving feedback, separate what you saw or heard from your feelings about the situation. Give specific examples of what you noticed rather than general comments. Tell them what you saw or heard, and then ask about their explanation of events. Now put your heads together to come up with ideas for handling the situation next time.
* If a conflict erupts, make sure all sides get to share their view point. Don't step in to resolve every conflict for the team because otherwise they rely on you as a peacemaker rather than learning to get along.
* Use gradients of agreement to reveal the level of support for a change. This allows the team to find out whether there is major or only minor disagreements.

### 3 Leading Change

People need to understand what's driving the change before they'll throw energy into it. Engage them in designing change by asking questions and building on their ideas.

#### 3.1 Introducing Change

* Tell stories about other Agile teams you have worked with to give them an appreciation of what's possible.
* Talk about "When we…" rather than "If we…," and then make sure they know you're there to provide support and help them keep going.
* Allow time for new ideas to soak in.

You have to do more than suggest a course of action for people to follow it. You need to lead the way by explaining why it's important and then show them how to get started with it.

##### Show Them How

**Educate the team:** Arrange an in-house training course so they can learn how to write unit tests.

**Demonstrate:** Pair with developers to show them how to write unit tests.

**Make it visible:** Work with the team to agree on a goal for how many unit tests they will write every day; track progress toward this goal on the team board.

##### Sell the Problem

Before sharing ideas for improvement, sell the problem that is driving the change. Paint a clear picture of the likely outcome if the team does not make changes. You can sell a problem more convincingly if you can point to supporting evidence.

As a coach, your focus is on process improvement, not individual performance.

##### Building Ownership for Change

Encourage team members to look at the positive outcomes of improving the Agile process. People are more likely to follow through when it's their idea.

##### Make Change and Experiment

Framing a change as an experiment helps focus the team on the benefit because you'll need to discuss how to evaluate whether the experiment is a success.

Once a team tries change as an experiment, team members get used to the new way of working. Each change they adopt reduces their resistance to the next change.

#### 3.2 Asking Questions

When you ask someone a question, you show that you respect their opinion and you're interested in their answer.

Here are some powerful questions you can ask:

* What could we do to stop this bug from happening again?
* How can we ship on time?
* How can we work more effectively?

Use questions to challenge their beliefs about how the organization works and what they can and cannot do. Help them see when assumptions they have made haven't been verified.

Ask open-ended questions to encourage conversation and invite the person to reflect and share their opinion.

##### What to Ask

###### Ask for Help
Share a problem with an individual and solicit ideas.

###### Thinking Questions
* How long have you been thinking about this problem?
* How often do you think about this?
* Are you satisfied with the amount of thought you have given this problem?
* Can you spot any gaps in your thinking?
* What insights are you having?

Thinking questions encourage the person to make a mental shift and think about the problem at a more strategic level.

###### Reflective Questions
Encourage the team to notice more about how they work by asking questions about what they noticed afterward.

###### Five Whys
Five Whys is a technique, invented by Taiichi Ohno, that you can use with the team to do root cause analysis.

Start by asking about the surface problem. Come up with a solution for that, and then dig down further by asking what caused the surface problem, what caused that, and what caused that.

The Five Whys is a powerful technique; however, it can expose problems that are outside the control of the team and have to be escalated to the right level in the organization.

##### When Not to Ask Questions

* Take care not to ask questions when you actually want to give guidance.
* If all you ever do is ask questions, it can seem like you're holding out and not sharing what you know.
* Asking questions might not help where trust between you and a person is low.

#### Encouraging Learning

* Encourage team to allow time for learning in their plans.
* Encourage them to take the initiative to learn about it for themselves.

##### Create Learning Opportunities

* Make it easy for people to access a variety of learning resources.
* Let the team see that you spend time on learning and share lessons.
* Let team members give talks to demonstrate what they have learned.
* Generate interest by bringing in an expert to give a lecture.

##### Going Outside the Organization to Learn

* Conferences are a great way to expose the team to new ideas.
* Encourage sharing of what was learned.

#### 3.4 Facilitating Meetings

The first time the team tries a new Agile meeting, such as a retrospective or planning meeting, offer to facilitate the meeting to show them how it's done. During the meeting, explain the process you're following to the team so they can learn how to facilitate the meeting themselves.

Here are some tips to help make your meetings effective.

**Choose a time:** Establish a meeting time that works for the whole team, and give them plenty of notice about any preparation they need to do.

**Set up the space:** Consider what kind of space you want for the meeting. Avoid meeting rooms with very large tables because this spreads the team too far apart to see index cards on the table. You'll also need something to capture notes on, such as a flip chart or whiteboard.

**Focus the meeting:** Start the meeting by clearly stating the purpose of the meeting and giving a quick overview of the agenda. Remind the team of any working agreements or ground rules for the meetings.

**Keep it flowing:** Stay on your toes during the meeting, and ensure the conversations in the meeting stay on topic and are productive. When you act as a "facilitator," your aim is to make the meeting easier for the people in it--like oil in an engine. You keep the meeting moving and focused on producing useful output. This is easier to do if you are not taking an active position in the discussion--step back to maintain a neutral position. If you need to offer an opinion, then explicitly step out of the facilitator role.

**Encourage everyone to participate:** Make sure everyone's opinion is heard. This means only one person talking at a time. When someone is making broad generalizations, it can help to ask for examples and ask clarifying questions to draw out the details.

**Summarize key points:** Before you write up any points on the whiteboard, check to see you have really understood they point by repeating what you heard.

**Close the meeting:** When you bring the meeting to a close, make sure that outputs are recorded appropriately. Taking digital photographs is a quick way to capture whiteboard sketches and meeting notes. 

#### Hurdles

The following are some hurdles you may encounter.

##### Some People Don't Change

Don't get hung up on trying to convince laggards.

##### Bumping into Company Politics

* Politics become an issue when you are perceived as a threat to existing power.
* Be careful not to get too closely aligned with an authority figure.
* Make it clear you are not a spy from management and you're there to serve them.

##### Conflicting Agendas

* Sometimes it's hard to maintain your focus when others are looking to you for support.
* Be neutral in public, explain in private the need to "pick our battles."
* Work together to introduce their change at the right opportunity.

#### 3.6 Checklist

* Share you passion for Agile, with being too fanatical. Talk about it, demonstrate it, and offer to help others with it. Encourage and inspire the team that Agile can and does work.
* Sell the problem to the team. Help them see why they need to change. What are the long-term implications of staying with the status quo? Also talk to the team members individually. How will they personally benefit from the change?
* When you meet resistance, try to understand where it's coming from. Is the problem with the idea or with the way you presented it? Are there good reasons to be concerned about the proposed idea? Are you listening properly to their concerns?
* Ask questions to engage the team in improving their Agile process. Try asking for help to enlist support, ask thinking questions to provoke reflection, and use Five Whys for root cause analysis.
* Encourage different ways to learn about Agile: leave books around the office, share blogs that you read, and point people to podcasts. Organize presentations and study groups that are open to other teams in the organization. Let people know about upcoming Agile events, and take people with you to the local Agile user group.
* Make new meetings easy for the team by facilitating then the first time around. Give them a running commentary so they can hear your thought process about running the meeting. The next time, help the team prepare for the meeting, and give them feedback afterward.

### 4 Building and Agile Team

Cohesive teams take time to jell. Establish conditions for teamwork. Environment should support working together to build software.

#### 4.1 Helping a Team Jell

An effective team runs like a well-oiled machine.

##### Social Glue

By working together, the team will start to understand one another's perspective and problems. Create opportunities for people to get to know each other better.

##### Build Trust

Team collaboration requires trust.

> Trust builds on reasonable self-disclosure.
> - George Dinwiddie

* Show it is safe to be open.
* Be transparent about motives.
* Disclose your experiences, opinions and feelings.
* Admit mistakes
* Ask for help

People do not feel safe in a blame culture. Trust requires safety.

##### Bridge the Gap

Understand different disciplines by playing another role. Pair and contribute as much as possible. Without mutual respect the team will not flourish.

#### 4.2 Creating a Team Space

Workspace to keep communication flowing. It is hard to build and Agile team when people are segregated.

* Shared
* Break-out area
* Meeting room

Encourage the team to design their own workspace and customize it to suit them. Plants, books, and pictures can make a space feel safer to work in.

The virtual environment needs to support collaboration too.

* Set up wikis and shared repositories.
* Be consistent with development and testing environments.

#### 4.3 Balancing Roles

The relationship between customers and developers is crucial because they need to work together to create the best product. Everyone needs to feel like they are part of the same team, working toward the same goal. Make responsibilities clear to the whole team.

* Customer owns business case and prioritizes what software should do.
* Development team decides how to build it and how long it will take.

A customer team must contain all the necessary experience to work out the user stories and prioritize them.

Sometimes the best solution is a "near-customer," who helps work out the details of the requirements with the team, and a "far-customer," who makes the decisions about business priorities.

If the roles get out of balance, one side or the other will be overworked. You can help as a coach by making the side effects of the imbalance more visible so management can consider addressing the problem.

#### 4.4 Energizing the Team

Sometimes teams get stuck or overwhelmed.

##### Not Too Easy, Not Too Hard

The secret to great teams is they need reachable but challenging goals.

* Break work into meaningful chunks
* Automate the easy stuff
* Encourage experimentation and trying new ideas

##### Find a Compelling Goal

Knowing they are producing a useful product should help the team engage.

* Understand the big picture and the team mission.
* Team should meet end users.
* Connect opportunities to personal goals.

##### Time for Innovation

Developers get burned out working on a continuous stream of user stories. Teams become demotivated without time to explore new technology or experiment with innovative products. Help the team find their own mini-projects by listening to them and encouraging them to follow-up on ideas.

**Gold Cards** allow team members to work on anything they want for the day. Each get two cards per month and can use them together for collaborative projects and learning.

##### Celebrate Success

* Lunch or drinks
* Demos
* Thanks from management
* Feedback from users

##### Don't Demotivate

* People are happy about the work they do.
* People are unhappy with the situation in which they do it.

Situational problems include stress and company culture. Hygiene factors are not noticed until they are absent.

##### Beware of Incentives

Incentive schemes encouraging indvidual productivity damage collaboration and foster competition. The team will work better when they're motivated by the satisfaction of doing a good job and producing a great product.

#### 4.5 Hurdles

The following are some hurdles you may encounter.

##### Teams Aren't Cross-Functional

A fundamental Agile priniciple is cross-functional teams with different disciplines working together to build the best software. Hand-offs between disciplines cause delays.

##### No On-Site Customer

Working with remote customers can cause communication problems and resentment. Meet when possible and encourage conversation on multiple channels. Humans are wired to respond to seeing faces.

##### Team is Too Big

Teams with more than 10 members have long meetings and less individual responsibility. Break projects into feature teams.

##### Team is a Resource Pool

Agile assumes one project at a time. Changing priorities causes interruptions and lack of focus on the goal.

##### Team Members Ostracize Someone on Their Team

If team avoids one person get an explanation from both sides.

##### Team Becomes Complacent

* Increase visibility of work to senior stakeholders.
* Increase feedback to team about business value generated by their work.

#### 4.6 Checklist

* Create opportunities for the team to get to know each other, which helps the team jell. Regularly spend informal time together, such as lunch or drinks.
* Create a shared workspace to help the team work together well. Try to get the whole team sitting together.
* Make role responsibilities clear. Get the customer support they need to work within the team.
* Ensure the team has a reachable but challenging goal. Make sure the work is neither too easy nor too hard.
* Arrange food or drink to celebrate a release. Ask customers and management to that the team.

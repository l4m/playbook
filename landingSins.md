# The Seven Deadly Sins of Landing Page Design

Optimizing landing pages has a better ROI than increasing traffic. Clicks are competitive and expensive. You have control over conversions.

Have an objective viewpoint. Visitors are the only ones that matter.

* Who are your customers?
* How did they arrive?
* What are they trying to accomplish?

Consider the experience from their perspective. Remove barriers making the process difficult.

## 1. Unclear Call-to-Action
What am I supposed to do?

* Remove distractions.
* Make sure users focus attention on what they need to do.
* Every element on the page should support the CTA.

## 2. Too Many Choices

* Remove clutter.
* Make the trail obvious.

## 3. Asking For Too Much Information

Only request the information necessary to complete the transaction.

* Keep forms short. Only ask for what is required to move them to next step.
* Only ask for more information once you have proven value. **Even email addresses.**

## 4. Too Much Text
Do not expect users to read.

* Write in editorial tone.
* Important stuff up front.
* Use bulleted lists.

## 5. Not Keeping Your Promises
Do you deliver on what you say?

Consider the flow:
* Where did they come from?
* What did the ad say?
* Does the landing page support the next step?

Make it easier for them to accomplish what they came for. Do not trick or add barriers.

## 6. Visual Distractions
* Brains are dedicated to processing information.
* Do not add interruptions.

## 7. Lack of Trust
Is it safe to make this transaction?

Building trust online is difficult. And must be done in the first few seconds to limit bounces.

* You have to do it instantly. Build trust above the fold.
* You have to do it anonymously. Most vistors do not konw you.

What are the questions visitors are asking themselves?
How do you address their objections?
